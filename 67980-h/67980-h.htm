  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have the conviction that due honour has never yet
been paid to Samuel Wesley. The praises of his noble
wife have been sung loudly and long; and no one acquainted
with her character and history, can doubt that
Mrs Wesley deserves all the laurels that have been
awarded her. While the general public, however, have
justly regarded her as a lady of the most eminent abilities,
and most exalted piety, they have been in danger
of thinking that her husband, though learned, was often
foolish; and though pious, was painfully eccentric, stern,
and quarrelsome. This is utterly unfounded, and cruelly
unjust. I submit, with all due deference to others, that
while the Methodists owe an incalculable debt of gratitude
to “the mother of the Wesleys,” they owe an equal
debt to the honest-hearted father. I trust that the
present work contains sufficient evidence of this.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is also hoped that the following pages will help the
reader to a better understanding of the position occupied
by Samuel Wesley’s sons, John and Charles; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>of the difficulties and discouragements encountered by
the illustrious first Methodists.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Memoirs of the Wesley Family,” by Dr Clarke,
though loosely written, have been of great service in the
compilation of the present volume; but a large number
of other works have also been consulted. I have carefully
examined everything that Mr Wesley published,
except perhaps his first political pamphlet; and as that
was published anonymously, I cannot be <em>certain</em> that I
have seen it. I am not aware that there is any <em>printed</em>
matter, casting light on Mr Wesley’s history, that I
have not laid under contribution. To have cited all
the authorities from which the work has been compiled,
would have crowded the margin with an inconvenient
number of titles of tracts, pamphlets, and books. A few
are given, and the remainder can be easily adduced if
needed.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the chapters on national affairs, I am largely indebted
to Macaulay, and to Knight’s “Pictorial History
of England;” also to the <cite>Tatler</cite>, <cite>Spectator</cite>, and <cite>Guardian</cite>;
and to other publications of a kindred character.
In some instances, quotations have not been
marked by inverted commas; because they have not
been made continuously, but pickings from ten or a
dozen pages of another work have been put into half a
page of this. I hope that this general acknowledgment
will save me from the charge of plagiary.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few original letters are now for the first time published.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>For three of these, I am indebted to the kind
courtesy of the Rev. Elijah Hoole, D.D.</p>

<p class='c001'>The portrait is taken from the large engraving published
in the year of Mr Wesley’s decease, in his “Dissertations
on the Book of Job.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The work has been a labour of love; and if the reader
derives as much profit and pleasure in perusing it as the
author has had in writing it, I shall be amply satisfied.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'><span class='large'>CHAPTER I.</span> <br />TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO—1640–1665.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Samuel Wesley was born a little more than two hundred years
ago; and a brief review of the state of the nation and of the
Church at that period will be useful in illustrating some parts of
his history.</p>

<p class='c001'>From March 1629 to April 1640, the houses of legislature had
not assembled; never in English history had there been an interval
of eleven years between one parliament and another. Charles I.
had systematically attempted to make himself a despot, and to
reduce the parliament to a nullity.</p>

<p class='c001'>To make bad things worse, Archbishop Laud, in the year 1640,
convened Convocation, which ordered that every clergyman
should instruct his parishioners once a quarter, in the divine right
of kings, and the damnable sin of resistance to authority. By the
divine right of kings was meant, that the Supreme Being regarded
hereditary monarchy, as opposed to other forms of government,
with peculiar favour; that the rule of succession, in order of primogeniture,
was a divine institution anterior to the Christian, and
even to the Mosaic dispensation; that no human power, not even
that of the whole legislature, could deprive the legitimate prince
of his rights; and that the laws by which, in England and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>other countries, the prerogative was limited, were to be regarded
merely as concessions, which the sovereign had freely made, and
which he might at his pleasure resume.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the same ecclesiastical parliament, all clergymen and all
graduates in the universities were required to take an oath, that
everything necessary for salvation was contained in the doctrine and
discipline of the Church of England, as distinguished from Presbyterianism
and Papistry; and they were also required to swear that
they would not consent to any alteration of the government of the
Church, by archbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons. Those refusing
to take such oaths were threatened with heavy penalties.</p>

<p class='c001'>This assumption of ecclesiastical power, on the part of Convocation,
was most offensively absurd. The nation for years had
been divided both in politics and religion; and it was not to be
expected that such decrees could be issued without provoking resistance
and creating trouble. Hence, in the same year, and in
the year following, we find a crowd of events which exerted a most
powerful influence on the subsequent history of the nation. The
House of Commons, which, after an interval of eleven years, was
again brought together, appointed a grand committee of the whole
house to inquire into the scandalous immoralities of the clergy.
Above two thousand cases were presented, and the work of cleansing
the Augean stable became so heavy, that the grand committee had
to divide itself into four or five sub-committees, called White’s,
Corbett’s, Harlow’s, and Dearing’s committees, after the chairman
of each. An act also was passed by the House of Commons, that
the clergy should not be magistrates, neither should officiate as
judges in civil courts. Lord Strafford—eloquent and bold, but
imperious and cruel, Charles’s most trusted counsellor, and one
whose object it had been to make his royal master as absolute a
monarch as any in Europe—was arrested, tried, and beheaded.
The Star Chamber and the High Commission courts, the former
a political, the latter a religious inquisition, were abolished.
Thirteen bishops were impeached by the Lower House of Parliament,
Archbishop Laud being one of them. The London apprentices
began their riots. Two hundred thousand Protestant
men, women, and children, were massacred in Ireland, and thousands
more had to flee to England, naked and famished, to obtain
subsistence. The papistical butchers, not satisfied with this, proceeded
to threaten that, when they had wreaked their vengeance on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the handful left in Ireland, they would come to England, and inflict
upon the Protestants there the same barbarities.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was impossible for such events to happen without public
feeling being excited to the highest pitch. The parliament was
aroused; the country rose to arms; and the civil wars commenced.
The Commons passed a resolution that they would never consent
to any toleration of the popish religion, either in Ireland or any
other part of his majesty’s dominions; and another bill was passed
excluding bishops from the House of Lords. From this date, the
Church of England, if not entirely demolished, may be regarded
as a ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1642, a committee was appointed by the House of Commons to
inquire “what malignant clergymen had benefices in and about
London, which benefices, being sequestered, might be supplied by
others, who should receive their profits;” and in the year following,
the “Scandalous Committee” of 1640, and the “Plundering Committee”
of 1642, (as the royalists called them,) were empowered to
act in concert; and, by their united efforts, the Church was well-nigh
cleared both of the clergymen who were immoral, and of those
whose opinions did not harmonise with the opinions generally entertained
by parliament. Many left their cures, and took sanctuary in
the king’s armies; others were put under confinement in Lambeth,
Winchester, and Ely; and about twenty were imprisoned beneath
deck in ships on the river Thames, no friend being allowed to come
near them. Several pious and worthy bishops and other clergymen,
who desired to live peaceably without joining either side, had
their estates and livings sequestered, and their houses and goods
plundered, and were themselves reduced to live upon the fifths, a
small pension from parliament. Among these may be mentioned,
Archbishop Usher, Bishops Morton and Hall, and the no less renowned
Jeremy Taylor, who, driven from his living at Uppingham,
retired into Wales, and, while supporting himself and his family
by teaching a school, there composed some of the greatest of his
immortal works.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the space of about two years, the country might be said to
be without any established form of worship. The clergy were left
to read the liturgy, or not to read it, as they pleased, and to use
equal discretion as to wearing the canonical habits, or the Geneva
cloak. The ecclesiastical polity of the realm was in total confusion.
Episcopacy was the form of government prescribed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the old law of the land, which was not repealed; but the form of
government prescribed by parliamentary ordinance was presbyterian;
and yet, neither the old law, nor the parliamentary
ordinance, was practically in force. The Church actually established
may be described as an irregular body, made up of a few
presbyteries, and of many independent congregations, all held
down and held together by the authority of government. Cathedral
worship was almost everywhere abolished, and many of the
sacred edifices themselves defaced and injured. By the parliamentary
ordinance of 1643, clergymen, both bad and good, were
ejected from their benefices by thousands; altars and stone tables
in churches were destroyed; candlesticks, tapers, and basins
standing upon communion tables were unsparingly removed; and
all crosses, crucifixes, images, and superstitious pictures and paintings
demolished. Churches and sepulchres, fine works of art and
curious remains of antiquity, met with the same ruthless treatment.
In Chichester Cathedral, the rabble, meeting with the
portrait of King Edward VI., picked out its eyes, because Edward
had established the Book of Common Prayer. In Canterbury
Cathedral, where they found the arras-hangings, representing the
history of Christ, they swore they would stab the picture of our
Saviour, and rip up its bowels, which they did accordingly; while
at the south gate, they discharged forty muskets at a carved figure
of Christ, and rejoiced exceedingly when they hit it on the head or
face. At Lichfield, they stabled their horses in the body of the
church, polluted the orchestra, baptized a calf at the baptismal
font, and hunted a cat with hounds every day throughout the
windings of the sacred edifice.</p>

<p class='c001'>While such proceedings were taking place in cathedrals and
churches, parliament was passing sharp laws against betting, and
enacting that adultery should be punished with death. Public
amusements, from masques in the mansions of the great, down to
wrestling and grinning matches on village greens, were vigorously
attacked. All the May-poles in England were ordered to be hewn
down. Play-houses were to be dismantled, the spectators fined,
and the actors whipped at the cart’s tail. Magistrates dispersed
festive meetings, and put fiddlers in the stocks. The zeal of the
soldiers was still more formidable, for in every village where they
happened to appear, there was an end of dancing, bell-ringing, and
hockey.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Meanwhile several sects sprung into existence, whose eccentricities
surpassed anything that had ever been seen in England. A
mad tailor, named Ludowick Muggleton, wandered from pothouse
to pothouse, tippling ale, and denouncing eternal torments against
those who refused to believe, on his testimony, that the Supreme
Being was only six feet high, and that the sun was just four
miles from the earth. Another sect of fanatics, which now sprung
up, were the Fifth Monarchy Men, so called because they taught
that the four great monarchies of the world were about to be succeeded
by the monarchy of Christ, who would reign among mankind
for a thousand years. The powers of earth were to be utterly
destroyed, and Christ to be king alone. Acting upon their fanatical
principles, in 1660 they scoured the streets of London, committing
murder, without distinction of age or sex, till they came
to Aldersgate Street, where they halted, and proclaimed king Jesus,
crying out, “No king but Christ.” These enthusiasts fought like
lions; but, of course, were overpowered. A number of them were
killed in the skirmish that took place in scattering them; and sixteen,
who were taken prisoners, were drawn on sledges from Newgate
through Cheapside to a place opposite their meeting-house in
Swan Ally, Coleman Street, where they were hanged and quartered,
their quarters being afterwards set upon the four gates of
the city. George Fox, also, raised a tempest of derision by proclaiming
that it was a violation of Christian sincerity to designate
a single person by a plural pronoun; and that it was an idolatrous
homage to Janus and Woden to talk about January and
Wednesday. He hated Episcopacy, steeple houses, and the liturgy;
and propounded the most extravagant whimsies concerning postures,
dress, and diversions. One of his coadjutors was John
Hinks, first a shepherd’s boy, and then a shoemaker, prodigiously
ignorant, and yet an enthusiast, who pretended to be inspired.
James Naylor was another of Fox’s mad associates, a man who,
when he entered Bristol, stripped himself stark naked, had his
horse led in triumph by two women, while his nasal-twanged
followers strewed branches in his way, and shouted “Hosannah.”
Solomon Eccles, one of the Quakers’ chief teachers, went naked into
the church at Aldermanbury, in the time of divine service, bedaubed
all over with filth, as an emblem of the nakedness and filth
of the minister who was preaching. And two women, at Kendal,
of the names of Adlington and Collinson, are said to have walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>through the streets of that town in the same state of nudity, and
who, when friendly hands tried to cover them, rebuked such kindness,
by declaring that “it hindered the work of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, substantially, was the state of affairs, when, in 1643,
the Assembly of Divines met, by an ordinance of parliament, in the
city of Westminster, for “settling the government and liturgy
of the Church of England, and for vindicating and clearing the
said Church from false aspersions and interpretations.” The
Assembly consisted of thirty members of parliament, including
six noblemen; and of one hundred and twenty-one ministers, including
Dr Lightfoot, Edmund Calamy, and Joseph Caryl. Baxter
says, the divines were men of eminent learning and godliness,
ministerial abilities and fidelity. Each member of the Assembly
had four shillings a—day allowed by parliament towards his expenses.
They sat five years, six months, and twenty-two days,
during which time they had 1163 sessions. A few of the members
were attached to Episcopacy; but, finding themselves in a hopeless
minority, they soon retired. The great majority were in favour of
Presbyterianism; but these, to the last, were vigorously opposed
by a minority, consisting of two sections, who, although they generally
acted in concert against the common enemy, were also distinguishable
from each other. These were, first, the Independents;
and, secondly, the Erastians, so called because of their adoption of
the principles of Erastus, a German divine of the preceding century,
who maintained that the Church, or the clergy, as such, possessed
no inherent legislative power of any kind, and that the
National Church was, in all respects, the mere subject and creature
of the civil magistrate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the men to whom was committed the work of building
up a new ecclesiastical polity. By their advice alterations
were made in the Thirty-nine Articles, the intention being to
render their sense more express and determinate in favour of Calvinism.
In 1645, their “Directory of Public Worship” supplanted
the liturgy, and was established by an ordinance of parliament.
They also agreed in introducing and enforcing the Solemn League
and Covenant, by which Episcopacy was abjured. In 1646, the
name, style, and dignity of archbishops and bishops were formally
abolished; and, in 1649, the “Confession of Faith,” which laid
down a Presbyterian system of ecclesiastical polity, received the
sanction of an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Many difficulties, however, stood in the way of the actual extension
of this new system over the whole kingdom; and, in fact, it
never obtained more than a very limited and imperfect establishment.
Accordingly, the National Church of England, during the
Commonwealth, was by no means exclusively composed of Presbyterians,
(though they were the most numerous,) for some of the
benefices were still retained by their old Episcopal incumbents; a
considerable number were held by Independents, and a few were
filled even by the minor sects, that now swarmed in the sunshine
of the Protector’s all but universal toleration.</p>

<p class='c001'>King Charles was beheaded in 1649, and Oliver Cromwell was
appointed Lord Protector in 1653. A quarter of a century before
he was raised to this high position, Cromwell had openly deserted
the Church of England, and attached himself to the Puritans,
who were just then rising into wealth and power. Under the
Commonwealth, the Dissenters increased in numbers, and exercised
a predominating influence in national affairs. Besides being incumbents
of parish churches, their ministers officiated as chaplains
of political bodies; and preached to mayors and aldermen, as
they sat arrayed in golden chains and scarlet robes at Guildhall
festivals. The rights of presentation to church livings were still
retained to patrons; but, to prevent abuses, Cromwell, in 1653,
appointed a Board of Commissioners to examine all candidates for
holy orders, and without whose sanction none could be admitted
to a church benefice. These “Triers,” as they were called,
were thirty-eight in number. Part of them were Presbyterians,
part were Independents, and a few were Baptists. Among them
were Dr Thomas Goodwin, Dr John Owen, Joseph Caryl, the
author of the gigantic Commentary on the Book of Job, and
Thomas Manton, whose writings, so full of sanctified genius, will
be prized by the Church of Christ to the end of time. Baxter
tells us that the Triers, with all their faults, did a great amount of
good. They saved many a congregation from ignorant, ungodly,
drunken teachers. All that either preached against a godly life,
or preached as though they knew not what it was; and all those
that used the ministry as a common trade, and merely as a means
of getting bread, were usually rejected; while all who were able,
serious preachers, and whose lives were holy, were admitted, of
whatsoever opinions they were, so long as their opinions were
“tolerable.” The authority of Cromwell’s Triers was almost unlimited,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and, certainly, was not unneeded. Previous to their appointment,
any one who wished might set up to be a preacher,
and so give himself a chance of obtaining a living in the Church.
Now, every candidate for the pulpit and emoluments of a parish
church had to bring to the Board of Triers, sitting at Whitehall,
a testimonial, subscribed by the hands of three persons of known
goodness and integrity, one of whom, at least, had to be a preacher
of the gospel in some constant settled place. On the candidate
passing his examination, he was inducted to the church living, to
which he had been presented, by a document, given in the name
of the Triers, signed by the State Registrar, and sealed with the
seal of the Commonwealth. He then took possession, cultivated
the glebe lands, prayed, if he choose, without book or surplice, and
administered the eucharist to communicants seated at long tables.
In some instances there was also formed a sort of independent
church outside the parish church, to whom the preacher administered
the sacraments, not in the parochial edifice, but in private
houses. It is impossible to ascertain the exact number of these
beneficed Dissenters, under the Commonwealth, but it may be
safely inferred, that they were numerous, when it is borne in mind
that, after the elevation of Cromwell to the Protectorate, they were
favoured by the ruling powers; and, after the Restoration, were
regarded by their opponents with great anxiety.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the two, the Presbyterians were more numerous than the
Independents, and, in many instances, the feeling between the
parties was anything but brotherly. Cromwell had tried to be
impartial, and to allow all classes, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Independents, and Baptists, to have a fair share of church emoluments,
and thereby he hoped to secure something like church
amity, but the effort was futile and the hope not realised.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the ministers who, during the Commonwealth, occupied
the pulpits of England, there were not a few who will always rank
among England’s most powerful preachers, and most profound
divines. Besides these there were likewise men in the country belonging
to other classes, whose names will ever be invested with a halo
of honour. Dr Busby was master of Westminster School, and celebrated
alike for his classical abilities and unflinching discipline.
Vandyke was putting on canvas his unequalled portraits; and
Inigo Jones reviving classical architecture. There were also Andrew
Marvell, renowned as the first of patriots and of wits; George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Withers, some of whose earlier poetry, especially, abounds in the
finest bursts of sunshine; John Milton, Cudworth, Sir Thomas
Browne, and others of a like character.</p>

<p class='c001'>The morals of the nation, up to the time of Charles’s execution,
were about as bad as badness could make them. The chief amusements
of the court were masques, and emblematic pageants, some
of which cost more than £20,000 each. Extravagance in dress and
personal adornment had become an absolute phrenzy. James I.,
when transported from the scantily-furnished halls of Holyrood to
the plentiful palaces of the south, burst from a clumsy, ungainly
figure into a gilded coxcomb, almost daily figuring in a new suit,
and his courtiers copying his example. When Buckingham was
sent ambassador to the court of France, his suit of white velvet
was set all over with diamonds, valued at £80,000; and, besides
this, he had another suit of purple satin, embroidered with pearls
worth £20,000. In fact, the beaux of this period were animated
trinkets. Prodigality in feasting soon became as conspicuous as
extravagance in dress; and gambling kept pace with both. The
manners of the court, and of both sexes in the higher classes, were
gross in the extreme. English taverns were dens of filth, tobacco
smoke, roaring songs, and roysterers; and yet, even in such places,
women of rank allowed themselves to be entertained, and tolerated
those freedoms from their admirers which are described with such
startling plainness in our old plays and poems. The streets of
London, and even of the inferior towns, were filled with prowling
sharpers; and the highways of England were equally infested with
robbers, concealing their faces with visors, and carrying in their
pockets false tails for their otherwise well-known horses. Divination
was a thriving business; and fortune-telling was frequently
a cover to the worse trades of pandering and poisoning. The
stars were more eagerly studied than the diurnals; and both
cavaliers and roundheads thronged to astrologers to learn the
events of the succeeding week. Exorcising devils was common,
and the belief in witches became the master superstition of the
age; so that between three and four thousand persons are said to
have been executed for witchcraft between the year 1640 and the
Restoration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course, during the Commonwealth, when Puritan principles
were in the ascendancy, a great change came over the general
manners and morals of the land. Republican simplicity prevailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in the banquets at Whitehall; Scotch collops, marrow puddings,
and hog’s-liver sausages forming standing dishes of Lady Cromwell’s
cookery. Religion was the language of the court, and also its
garb; prayer and fasting were fashionable exercises; and a godly
profession was the road to preferment. Not a play was acted in
all England for many years, and from the prince to the peasant
and common soldier, the features of Puritanism were almost universally
exhibited. Many doubtless were fanatics and others designing
knaves, whose whole religion consisted in the use of a religious
vocabulary and hypocritical grimace; but making all due allowance
for a large amount of unscriptural enthusiasm and pious
fraud, there were unquestionably among those sickly dreamers
and canting fanatics, thousands and tens of thousands of enlightened,
sincere, and earnest Christians.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cromwell died in 1658. Immediately after his death, the
Protectorate broke down under his son Richard, and confusion
became worse confounded. The army was unsettled, the parliament
divided, the republic was discouraged, trade decayed, and
the exchequer empty. The majority of the nation were weary
of change, and had no faith in ideal republics; and, by the spring
of 1660, public feeling was strongly in favour of the restoration
of Charles II. In the month of March, the Rump Parliament was
finally dissolved. All the bells in London were set a ringing;
and, as Pepys tells us, bonfires blazed on every side, there being
not fewer than fourteen burning, at the same time, between St
Dunstan’s and Temple Bar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Presbyterians now stood foremost, and, in Parliament, were
the leaders. The League and Covenant was hung on the walls of
the House of Commons, and was ordered to be read in every
church once a year; but in March 1660, as an indication of other
changes coming, Dr John Owen, Cromwell’s chaplain, was removed
from the deanery of Christ’s Church, Oxford, and Dr, afterwards
Bishop, Reynolds was appointed in his place. On the 30th of
April, a public fast was held, Reynolds and Hardy preaching before
the House of Lords; and Gauden, Calamy, and Baxter before
the House of Commons. On the 1st of May, Sir John Granville
arrived from Breda with despatches from Charles II.; one being
addressed to the House of Lords, and another to the House of
Commons. The latter contained the famous “Declaration of
Breda,” offering indemnity for the past, and liberty of conscience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>for the future. The declaration was, “We do declare a liberty to
tender consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted, or called
in question for difference of opinions, which do not disturb the
peace of the kingdom.” Within a fortnight after this, Charles
was proclaimed king, amid “festivals, bells, and bonfires,” Richard
Baxter preaching a sermon on the occasion, before the Lord Mayor
and Corporation of London.</p>

<p class='c001'>The restoration of Charles being settled, several members of the
Lords and Commons, on the 11th of May, started off to Holland
to meet him. The city of London sent commissioners, and with
them went certain Presbyterian ministers, as Reynolds, Manton,
and Calamy. These reverend brethren told the king that they
had urged the people to restore him to the throne of his father,
and declared themselves as no enemies to moderate Episcopacy;
but begged that his Majesty would dispense with the surplice
being worn, and that, instead of adopting the use of the Common
Prayer entirely and formally, he would direct that only some parts
of it should be read, with some superadded prayers by his chaplains.
At the end of the month Charles landed at Dover. The
castle guns bid him welcome. Thousands upon thousands, standing
upon the beach and cliffs, waved their hats, and gave right
hearty cheers. When he arrived in London, the corporation
waited in a tent at St George’s-in-the-Fields to receive him. All
the houses in Southwark, Cheapside, Fleet Street, and the Strand
were hung with banners and adorned with tapestry. The Livery
companies turned out in their velvet coats, silver doublets, and
rich green scarfs; while kettle-drums and trumpets made all
London ring again. Addresses flowed in from all quarters welcoming
the king back to Old England, and, among others, one
from the county of Devon, bearing among others the signature of
the celebrated Joseph Caryl.</p>

<p class='c001'>All seemed to be unanimous and jubilant; and yet all this was
but the beginning of the tug of war. Charles was a constitutional
king, and was to rule through parliaments. The Presbyterians,
who were still in power, expected royal favour for recent services,
and to be comprehended in some wide church establishment.
Independents, Baptists, and Quakers asked for toleration. Roman
Catholics, who had been friends to the beheaded father and the
exiled son, thought themselves entitled to consideration. While
the Episcopalians claimed the new monarch as their own, sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>exclusive re-establishment, wished to cast out all Presbyterian
intruders, and were inwardly resolved to tolerate no sectaries
whatever. Charles’s position was difficult and perplexing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alterations were soon made. The dioceses in England had
bishops appointed to them, though it was not until the next parliament,
in 1661, that the bishops took their places among the
peers. The Liturgy was immediately introduced into those parish
churches, where the ministers avowed themselves Episcopalians;
and, already, the reign of persecution had commenced. Even
before the king had landed at Dover, the Episcopal party in Wales
were busy sending sixty-eight Quakers to gaol; while the prison
at Montgomery was so full of Independents and Baptists that the
governor had to pack them into garrets. John Milton was committed
to the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, and was declared
to be disqualified for the public service; while his “Defence of
the English People” and his “Eikonoclastes” were ordered to be
publicly burned. Oliver Heywood was insolently harassed for a
twelvemonth with citations to appear before the Consistory Court
at York. Philip Henry was prosecuted for not reading the Common
Prayer, and John Howe was accused of treason for some
utterance in the pulpit. During the summer of 1660, a bill was
passed by parliament, which aimed at the expulsion of all who
had been inducted into church livings during the Commonwealth,
and the immediate restoration of all the clergy who had been
expelled. This bill included a proviso to the effect that the Presbyterian
and Independent ministers should not be bound to give
back livings which were legally vacant when they obtained them;
but there was another that almost rendered null the previous
one, viz., that every incumbent should be excluded that had not
been ordained by an ecclesiastic, or had renounced his ordination,
or had petitioned for bringing the late king to trial, or had justified
his trial and execution, in preaching or in writing, or had
committed himself in the vexed question of infant baptism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bill failed to give satisfaction to any party. The Episcopalians
complained that it was a thing of mean subterfuges and
compromises; while the Dissenters alleged that the Episcopalians
were monopolists of honours and preferments, and were waiting
to renew the persecutions of Archbishop Laud.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archbishop Usher, who died in 1656, had left behind him a
scheme of union, and a proposed plan of church government by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>suffragan bishops, and synods, and presbyteries conjointly. By
this plan he had fondly hoped to reconcile the two great religious
parties, the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians; and the latter,
being now hopeless of obtaining an entire supremacy, professed
their willingness to make Usher’s scheme the basis of negotiation.
The principal ministers, who were parties to this proposal, were
Dr Reynolds, Dr Manton, Dr Bates, Edward Calamy, and Richard
Baxter. They were promised a meeting with some Episcopal
divines in the presence of the king; but when the time
appointed came, instead of a meeting, the Presbyterians received
a paper rejecting their proposal, but telling them that they were
all to meet the king on October 22d, at the house of Lord Clarendon,
in the Strand, and that his Majesty would then adjust all
their religious differences. At the appointed meeting there were
present, besides the king, the Dukes of Albemarle and Ormond,
the Earls of Manchester and Anglesea, the six bishops of London,
Worcester, Salisbury, Durham, Exeter, and Lichfield, and six
Presbyterian ministers, viz., Reynolds, Spurstow, Wallis, Manton,
Calamy, and Baxter. The Presbyterians entrusted their cause to
the eloquence and learning of Calamy and Baxter; while the
chief speakers on the Episcopalian side were Dr Gunning and
Bishop Morley.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three days after this important meeting, Charles published
what is commonly called “The Healing Declaration.” This royal
manifesto, after commending the Episcopalians, and acknowledging
the moderation of the Presbyterians, promised—1, To encourage
religion; 2, To appoint suffragan bishops where dioceses were
thought to be too large; 3, Not to allow church censures to be
pronounced by bishops without the advice and assistance of the
presbyters; 4, To give deaneries to the most learned and pious
presbyters of the diocese; 5, Not to allow persons to come to the
Lord’s Supper without confirmation and a credible profession of
their faith; and 6, To appoint an equal number of learned divines
belonging to the Episcopalians and Presbyterians to revise the
Liturgy.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as this Declaration was made public, bishoprics were
offered to Reynolds, Baxter, and Calamy. Reynolds accepted the
see of Norwich; Baxter and Calamy declined. A fortnight after,
royal letters were issued commanding the University of Cambridge
to confer the diploma of D.D. on the three eminent Presbyterian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>ministers, William Bates, Thomas Jacombe, and Robert Wilde,
the king being fully satisfied “of their integrity and loyalty;” and,
at the same time, a bill was brought into the House of Commons
to make the king’s “Healing Declaration” law, but the bill was
lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>As time advanced, the prospects of the Dissenters became more
gloomy. On January 2, 1661, an Order in Council was made
against Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries meeting in large
numbers and at unusual times. The order also forbade any of
their assemblies being held out of their own parishes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shortly after this, at the request of Baxter, Lord Clarendon
made an arrangement for carrying into effect that part of the
king’s “Healing Declaration” which promised a revision of the
Liturgy. Twelve bishops and nine coadjutors were appointed to
represent the Episcopal party, and twelve leading divines and nine
coadjutors to represent the Presbyterian party. The twelve bishops
belonged to the dioceses of York, London, Durham, Rochester,
Chichester, Sarum, Worcester, Lincoln, Peterborough, Chester,
Carlisle, and Exeter. Among their coadjutors were some of the
most eminent men of the day, as Dr Heylin, and Dr Pearson,
immortalised by his profoundly able work on the Apostles’ Creed.
The twelve Presbyterian divines included Reynolds, Manton,
Calamy, and Baxter; and their coadjutors included the “silver-tongued”
William Bates and Dr Lightfoot. The place of meeting
was the old Savoy Palace, and the first day of their coming together
was April 15, 1661. Baxter proposed an entirely new Liturgy;
and, in the short space of a fortnight, prepared one. His brethren
meanwhile were employed in preparing exceptions to the old one,
which Baxter wished to set aside. Baxter seemed to be equal to
any amount of work assigned to him. When he brought his completed
draft of the new Liturgy to his co-commissioners, instead
of finding their exceptions to the old Liturgy finished, he found
them only just begun; and, as both the draft and the exceptions
had to be submitted to the Savoy Conference at the same time,
there was no alternative but to wait another fortnight; during
which Baxter himself prepared as many exceptions to the old
prayer-book as filled eight closely-printed folio pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the Conference reassembling, the Presbyterians read their
paper, pleading that, as the first Reformers composed the Liturgy
so as to draw the Papists into their communion, the Liturgy ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>now to be so revised as to unite all substantial Protestants. Hence
it was suggested that certain repetitions should be omitted; that
the Litany should be turned into one continued prayer; that neither
Lent nor Saints’ Days should continue to be observed; that
free prayer should be allowed; that the Apocrypha should not be
read in the daily lessons; that the word “minister” should be used
instead of the word “priest;” and “Lord’s-day” instead of “Sunday;”
that the Liturgy was defective in praise and thanksgiving;
that the Confession and Catechism were imperfect; and that the
surplice, the cross, and kneeling at the Lord’s Supper, were unwarrantable.
All these, however, were regarded as minor objections;
and the main ones that were raised were against the
baptismal service, the marriage service, the service for the visitation
of the sick, and the burial service.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the objections had been submitted to the Conference, the
bishops and their coadjutors rejected them <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in toto</i></span>. Baxter was
appointed to answer the reply of the bishops, and went out of
town, to Dr Spurstow’s house in Hackney, for that purpose. In
eight days his rejoinder was finished. Unprofitable disputes followed;
the Conference broke up; and nothing but vexation and
sorrow came out of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Presbyterians were now treated as the vanquished party;
and Baxter especially became the butt for malignant marksmen.
Almost every time he preached he was accused of treason; and
even his prayers were listened to with suspicion. Still, as the
parliament now sitting had been elected before the Restoration,
the Presbyterians in that assembly were too numerous and troublesome
to permit of summary suppression. Hence, in March 1661,
a new election was ordered, and great excitement followed. Alderman
Thompson, “a godly man of good parts, and a congregationalist,”
was one of the candidates for London; but the Royalists
objected to him, because he was “so fond of smoking that his
breath would poison a whole committee.” Dr Caryl and other
eminent ministers held a fast. Zachary Crofton preached against
bishops “every Sunday night, with an infinite auditory, itching,
and applause;” and Mr Graffen had a crowd of two thousand in
the streets, who could not get into his meeting-house to hear him
“bang the bishops.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The new parliament met on the 8th of May 1661; and the
change from Presbyterian to Episcopalian predominancy was manifested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>in one of the earliest orders,—viz., that the sacrament of
the Lord’s Supper, on the Sunday seven night, should be administered,
at St Margaret’s Church, according to the form prescribed
in the Liturgy of the Church of England; and that no one should
be admitted a member of that House who neglected to partake of
the Communion, either there publicly, or afterwards in the presence
of two or more witnesses. In addition to this, it was resolved
that “the Solemn League and Covenant,” the well-known symbol
of Presbyterian ascendancy—which, for a year past, had been
taken down from the walls of the House of Commons—should be
burnt by the common hangman; and this was done, the hangman
first tearing the document into pieces, and then burning the fragments
in succession,—he all the while lifting up his hands and
eyes in pious indignation, until not a shred was left.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Before the year was ended, the bishops took their place in the
House of Lords; and a bill was passed requiring all members of
corporations to swear that the “Solemn League and Covenant
was unlawful; and declaring that no one was eligible for office
who had not, within one year before, taken the sacrament according
to the rites of the Church of England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Added to this, another and a far more important bill was introduced:—“A
Bill for the Uniformity of Public Prayers and
Administration of the Sacraments.” The bill was first submitted
to Parliament in December 1661, and became law on the 19th of
May 1662. During this interval of five months the greatest excitement
prevailed throughout the nation. Loud and fierce were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the diatribes uttered from the Episcopal pulpit against Roundheads,
Anabaptists, and Quakers. Swarms of pamphlets and
broadsides were issued, to support Church and State by argument,
but more frequently by ridicule and satire. Many of these,
as “Noctroft’s Maid Whipt,” and the “Antidote of Melancholy
made up in Pills,” were coarse and filthy in a high degree. Of
course, sharp and bitter things were said and written on the Nonconformists’
side, but in none of their publications is there anything
like the abominable and indecent scurrility which the
royalist press published against them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before giving a synopsis of the Act of Uniformity, it may be
well to say, that the Book of Common Prayer, which it mentions,
was the book as revised by Convocation in November 1661.
About six hundred alterations had been made in the body of the
volume. Forms respecting the weather, prayers to be used at
sea, and emendations in the commination, and in the churching
of women services were introduced. The calendar was revised,
and the Apocrypha appointed to be read in the daily lessons.
The absolution was to be pronounced by the “priest,” instead of
by the “minister.” In the Litany, the words “rebellion and
schism” were added to the petition against sedition; and the
words, “bishops, priests, and deacons,” were substituted for
“bishops, pastors, and ministers of the Church.” A few new
collects were added, and, in one of them, a new epithet was added
to the title of Charles I., he being styled “our most religious
king.” None of these things were calculated to make the prayer-book
more palatable to the Presbyterian and Dissenting parties,
and hence the terrible rupture occasioned by the passing of the
Act of Uniformity.</p>

<p class='c001'>By that act it was provided, that “every parson, vicar, or
other minister whatsoever, now enjoying any ecclesiastical benefice
or promotion, within this realm of England,” who neglected
or refused to declare publicly, before his congregation, his “unfeigned
assent and consent to the use of all things contained and
prescribed” in the Book of Common Prayer, on some Lord’s-day
before the feast of St Bartholomew, in 1662, should be deprived of
all his spiritual promotions; and that, henceforth, it should be
lawful for all patrons and donors of such church livings to present
others to the same, as though the person or persons so
offending or neglecting were dead. The act further provided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>that all deans, canons, and prebendaries; also all heads, fellows,
and tutors of colleges; and likewise all schoolmasters, keeping
any public or private schools, should, before the same feast of
St Bartholomew, subscribe a declaration to the effect that they
would conform to the liturgy of the Church of England, as now
by law established; and that they renounced all obligation from
the oath commonly called “The Solemn League and Covenant,”
and regarded it as an unlawful oath, contrary to the laws and
liberties of the kingdom. It likewise enacted that all the church
functionaries above-mentioned who refused to subscribe to this
declaration were to be deprived of their promotions; and all
schoolmasters who refused were to suffer three months’ imprisonment.
It also provided that if any minister, not being a foreigner,
who was not episcopally ordained, should presume to administer
the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper after St Bartholomew’s day,
he should, for every such offence, forfeit the sum of £100; and
if he presumed to lecture or preach in any church, chapel, or other
place of worship whatever, within the realm of England, he should
suffer three months’ imprisonment in the common gaol. And
another, though minor provision was, that the parishioners of
every parish church, at their own cost, should provide for such
church, before the feast of St Bartholomew, a true printed copy
of the revised Book of Common Prayer; and that they should be
fined £3 for every month, after St Bartholomew’s, that they neglected
to obey such a mandate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the substance of that most momentous Act of Parliament.
What were the results? Terrible were the struggles in
many a good man’s breast during the fourteen weeks elapsing between
the 19th of May and the 24th of August 1662. As the
corn ripened, and the country rector sat with his wife in the snug
parlour, and looked out of the latticed windows on the children
chasing the butterflies in the garden, or gathering daisies on the
glebe, he had to decide in his heart and conscience whether he
should leave all this, or whether he should keep it. He must
either <em>conform</em>, or he and his family must <em>go</em>. Such was the
ugly alternative. The vicarage was comfortable and commodious;
the means of usefulness had bright attractions; and hardest
wrench of all it was, to snap the union between the shepherd and
his flock. To resolve to <em>go</em>, required now and then a woman’s
quiet fortitude to reinforce a man’s more loud resolve.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Meanwhile, mutterings of discontent and growlings of sedition
began to be heard on every hand. Rumours circulated that some
of the king’s regiments were disaffected; that trained bands were
refractory or negligent; that gunsmiths were dressing arms; and
that Lancashire ministers talked little less than treason. The
Court was uncertain whether to execute or to suspend the Act.
Presbyterian lords pleaded for indulgence; but Sheldon was opposed
to it. It was the long vacation, and few of the council
remained in town to decide the point. The nobility were at their
country seats enjoying the summer months. The bishops were
performing their visitations. Charles was at Hampton Court,
joking with his lords, toying with his mistresses, watching games
in the tennis court, and feeding ducks in the royal ponds. Time
travelled on, and the 23d of August came. All Quakers imprisoned
in the gaols of London and Middlesex were released, because
on that day Charles’s consort, Queen Catherine, first came “to
our royal palace at Westminster.” The Thames was covered with
boats almost without number. Music floated on the water, and
thundering peals roared from huge cannon on the shore. Charles
and his queen sailed in an open vessel covered with a canopy of
cloth of gold, which was supported by Corinthian pillars wreathed
with flowers, festoons, and garlands. This was Saturday.</p>

<p class='c001'>The previous Sunday had been a day such as England never
knew, either before or since.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Hundreds of faithful ministers
on that day preached farewell sermons to heart-broken, weeping
flocks. Churches were crowded; aisles and stairs were crammed
to suffocation; and people clung to the open windows like
swarms of bees. It would have been pardonable if the ministers
had mingled with the loving exhortations addressed to the distressed
crowds before them sentiments of indignation at the legislative
act which was the means of their removal. But, instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of that, the discourses were as calm as the pastors had ever
preached, and some of them scarcely alluded to the peculiar circumstances
of the time.</p>

<p class='c001'>A week after, on the day after Queen Catherine’s jubilant reception,
the Act of Uniformity was enforced in all its rigour, and
upwards of two thousand ministers, with their families, were
ejected from their livings.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“What a scene,” says John Wesley, “is opened here. The
poor Nonconformists were used without either justice or mercy;
and many of the Protestant bishops of King Charles had neither
more religion nor humanity than the Popish bishops of Queen
Mary.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> “By this Act of Uniformity, thousands of men, guilty
of no crime,—nothing contrary either to justice, mercy, or truth,—were
stripped of all they had—of their houses, lands, revenues—and
driven to seek where they could, or beg their bread. For
what? Because they did not dare to worship God according to
other men’s consciences!”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A large majority of the ministers in the Church conformed;
and these may be divided into three classes—first, those who had
been Presbyterians or Independents, or other sectaries, and who
on former occasions had more or less opposed Episcopacy and
the Book of Common Prayer; secondly, those who had already
conformed to previous changes—passively submitting to their
superiors for the time being, be they who they might; and,
thirdly, a class of consistent Episcopalians, including—1. such as
had been allowed to hold their livings, and to use the Prayer-book
even during the Commonwealth; 2. such as had been ejected
from their benefices, but had been reinstated since the Restoration;
and, 3. such as had been recently ordained, and inducted
into livings during the last twelve months. Many of these Conformists—as
Tillotson, Gurnall, Stillingfleet, Cudworth, and others—were
men of high character; but many others were low, mean,
grovelling spirits, who valued the priest’s office only because it
gave them a piece of bread. In a publication of that period, “the
parsonage house” is described “as holding scarcely anything but
a budget of old stitched sermons, hung up behind the door, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>a few broken girths, two or three yards of whipcord, and perhaps
a saw and a hammer to prevent dilapidations.” Macaulay, speaking
of the rural clergy, says: “Those who could, sported a few
Greek and Latin words for the benefit of the squire, and pitched
their discourses so as to accommodate themselves to the fine
clothes and ribbons in the highest seats of the church, instead of
seeking to instruct those of the congregation who had to mind
the plough and to mend the hedge.” And again, in reference to
the clergy in cities and corporations, he writes: “There were men
whose parts and education were no more than sufficient for their
reading the lessons, after twice conning over. An unlearned rout
of contemptible men,” says he, “rushed into holy orders just to
read the prayers, and who understood very little more of their
meaning than a hollow pipe would, made of tin or wainscot.”
Some idea may be formed of the character of many of the clergy
who conformed in 1662, from the fact that three years after,
during the great plague in London, instead of firmly remaining
at the post of duty when most needed, numbers of the London
clergy, like craven spirits, rushed off into the country, leaving
their pulpits to be occupied, and their afflicted and dying parishioners
to be cared for, by the very ministers who had been ejected
by the Act of Uniformity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Nonconformist ministers may be divided into several
classes:—1. Some were moderate Episcopalians, and would have
conformed to the Prayer-book and to the Church government that
were in use previous to the Commonwealth, but could not give
their unfeigned assent to all things in the Prayer-book as revised
by the Convocation of 1661. 2. Some were of no sect or party,
but liked what was good in all, without being able to adopt the
Prayer-book as prescribed. 3. Some were Presbyterians, of whom
Baxter says: “They were the soberest and most judicious, unanimous,
peaceable, faithful, able, and constant ministers that he had
ever heard or read of in the Christian world.” 4. Some were Independents,
of whom the same writer says: “They were serious,
godly men, some of them moderate, little differing from the Presbyterians,
and as well ordered as any; but others were more raw
and self-conceited, and addicted to separations and divisions, their
zeal being greater than their knowledge.” Perhaps Baxter was
hardly an unprejudiced witness respecting either the Presbyterians
or the Independents.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Amongst the ministers expelled by the Act of Uniformity,
there were not a few of the most remarkable men that the Church
in this country has ever had. Most of them were excellent
scholars, judicious divines, faithful and laborious pastors; men
full of zeal for God and religion, undaunted in the service of their
Master, diligent students, and powerful preachers. Especially
were they men of great devotion, pleading for almost hours together
at the throne of grace, and there inspired with faith, and
love, and zeal, which raised them to the highest rank of heroes,
and made them willing, not only to lose their livings, but to suffer
even martyrdom itself, rather than to prove traitorous to Christ and
to the liberties of His Church. More than two thousand of such
men were ejected from the Church benefices of this country in
1662, and a passing glance at some of them may help the reader
to remember others.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this portrait-gallery, let us point to Edmund Calamy, who
studied at the rate of sixteen hours a-day, was one of the most
popular preachers in the capital, and whose week-day lectures
were attended by such numbers of the nobility, that there were
seldom fewer than sixty carriages at his church’s gates. William
Bates, of graceful mien and comely person, generally reputed one
of the best orators of the age,—his voice charming, his language
neat, his style pleasing, his learning vast, his piety conspicuous,
and his “Harmony of the Divine Attributes” alone sufficient to
immortalise his memory. Samuel Annesley, who declared he
remembered not the time when he was not converted; the descendant
of a good family, whose estate was considerable; a man
of a large soul, of flaming zeal, and of extensive usefulness;
faithful in the ministry for fifty-five long years, during the last
thirty of which he enjoyed an uninterrupted assurance of God’s
forgiving love; a man of moderate learning, though an LL.D.,
but a most devoted Christian, and the father of Susannah Wesley.
Joseph Caryl, a man of great piety, learning, and modesty, and
author of a marvellous Commentary on the Book of Job, originally
published in eleven volumes quarto. Thomas Brookes, a very
affecting and useful preacher, rich in homely phrases and familiar
figures, and whose “Apples of Gold” are still prized as much as
ever. Matthew Pool, who spent ten years upon his “Synopsis
Criticorum,” in five volumes folio, and who, during its compilation,
used to rise between three and four o’clock every morning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Thomas Manton, a man of great learning, judgment, and integrity,
and respected by all who knew him; endowed with extraordinary
knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; his sermons clear and convincing;
his delivery natural, eloquent, quick, and powerful; his piety
answerable to his doctrines; and, to say nothing of his other
publications, which were very numerous, his discourses, including
those on the 119th Psalm, published in five volumes folio. Thomas
Gouge, who, besides preaching and visiting, catechised his church
every morning the year round; seldom merry, and yet never sad;
a man who set up and established three or four hundred schools
in Wales, which, to a great extent, were supported by himself.
Thomas Watson, eminent in the gift of prayer, a hard student, a
popular preacher, and author of “A Body of Divinity,” in the
shape of sermons on the “Assembly’s Catechism.” John Goodwin,
learned, clear-headed, and fluent; a thorough Arminian, and
the author of “Redemption Redeemed.” John Owen, whose
proficiency in learning was such, that he was admitted to the
University when he was a child only twelve years old; and who
pursued his studies with such diligence that, for several years, he
allowed himself but four hours’ sleep a-night; tall in stature,
affable in temper, charitable in spirit, and a friend of peace; a
man of enormous learning, and whose labours as a minister were
almost incredible; eminent for piety, an excellent preacher, and
whose writings are almost enough to fill a library. Stephen Charnock,
who spent most of his time in his study, except on Sundays,
when, by his sermons in the pulpit, he showed how well he had
employed the week; a man of strong judgment and lively imagination;
well skilled in the Hebrew and Greek of the Old and
New Testaments; a recluse, whose library was burnt in the great
fire of London, and who was writing his discourses on the “Attributes
of God,” when a peaceful death removed him to heaven.
Thomas Harrison, of whom Lord Thomund used to say, “He had
rather hear Dr Harrison say grace over an egg, than hear the
bishops pray and preach.” John Flavel, an unwearied student,
with an immense amount of both divine and human learning; a
plain but popular preacher, and the well-known author of “Husbandry
Spiritualised.” Isaac Ambrose, who, once a year, for the
space of a month, retired to a hut, in a wood near Preston, and,
avoiding all human converse, devoted himself to religious contemplation.
Richard Alleine, pious, prudent, diligent, and whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>well-known practical writings have been blessed to thousands.
Joseph Alleine, of solid intellect and great piety; a man whose
imprisonment for preaching hastened his death at the early age of
thirty-five, and whose “Alarm to the Unconverted” has been read
by myriads. Oliver Heywood, who, besides his stated work on
Sundays, one year preached more than a hundred times, kept fifty
fast days and nine days of thanksgiving, and, in the service of his
Master, travelled fourteen hundred miles. Philip Henry, who
preached a funeral sermon for every person whom he buried, but
whose excessive modesty was such that he would publish nothing
that he wrote. John Howe, who, when a young minister in Devonshire,
used to perform divine service on fast-days (at that time
frequent) as follows:—At nine in the morning he prayed for a
quarter of an hour; then read the Scriptures and expounded three
quarters of an hour; then prayed an hour; then preached another;
then prayed half an hour, after which the people sung for
fifteen minutes; he then prayed an hour more, preached another,
and then, with a prayer of half an hour, concluded a service which
lasted from nine in the morning until a quarter past three in the
afternoon;—John Howe, in person tall and graceful; with a
piercing but pleasant eye; singularly great in ministerial qualifications;
his power in prayer marvellous, and his writings too well
known to need description. And last, but not least, Richard
Baxter, a man to whom Lord Chancellor Clarendon offered a
bishopric, and whom Judge Jeffries, another government official,
addressed thus:—“Richard, Richard! thou art an old <a id='corr24.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='knave'>knave.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_24.26'><ins class='correction' title='knave'>knave.</ins></a></span>
Thou hast written books enow to fill a cart, every one of them as
full of sedition, indeed treason, as an egg is full of meat;”—Baxter,
“a man,” says his contemporary, William Bates, “with a noble
negligence of style; for his great mind could not stoop to the
affected eloquence of words;”—a man animated with the Holy
Spirit, and breathing celestial fire to inspire life into sinners dead
in trespasses and sins; a man whose expulsion from the Church
gave him time to write and publish most of his invaluable books,
some of which have been the means of converting more men from
sin to holiness than any other books in modern times;—a man,
says Dr Barrow, “whose practical writings were never mended,
and his controversial ones seldom confuted;”—a man holding
constant communion with God, and living in charity with men;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>whose life was a living sermon, and his conversation becoming a
citizen of heaven.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were some of the two thousand martyr spirits who were
ruthlessly ejected from their churches and their homes in 1662,
and, for years afterwards, had to live in obscurity and silence;
yea more, not only were they doomed to silence, but to suffering.
In 1664 the “Conventicle Act” was passed, which provided that
“every person above sixteen years of age present at any meeting
of more than five persons besides the household, under a pretence
of any exercise of religion, in other manner than is the practice
of the Church of England, shall, for the first offence, be sent to
gaol three months, till he pay a £5 fine; for the second offence,
six months, till he pay a £10 fine; and for the third offence, be
transported to some of the American plantations.” The execution
of this execrable act, to a great extent, was committed to the king’s
soldiers, who broke open every house where they fancied a few
Nonconformists might be gathered together for sacred service.
Close, unhealthy prisons were soon crammed with conscientious
victims, men and women, old and young; whilst others were
ruined in their estates by bribing the corrupt and rapacious
myrmidons of a licentious and persecuting court. If a few of
these persecuted people happened to be driven to madness and
insurrection, as now and then occurred, they were strung up on
the gallows, a dozen at a time, the <em>good-natured</em> king rarely exercising
the prerogative of mercy on their behalf.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1665 the plague broke out in London, and swept away one
hundred thousand of the inhabitants. The poltroon ministers in the
city churches fled, and the ejected ministers re-entered the forsaken
pulpits, and tried to benefit the terror-stricken people, whom the
new-fledged parsons had cowardly left to the pestilence and the
devil. The parliament, frightened from London, met in Oxford;
but there, instead of showing kindness to the men who were so
bravely doing duty in the city of the plague, they actually added
injury to injury, by passing the execrable “Five Mile Act,” which
provided that it should be a penal offence for any Nonconformist
minister to teach in a school, or to come within five miles
(except as a traveller in passing) of any city, borough, or corporate
town, or of any place in which he had preached or taught
since the passing of the Act of Uniformity, unless he had previously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>taken the oath of non-resistance—to wit, that it is not
lawful, under any pretence whatever, to take arms against the
king, or against those that are commissioned by him, or to endeavour
to make any alteration of the government, either in Church
or State.</p>

<p class='c001'>What was the result of all this? An amount of suffering was
endured far greater than had been inflicted, in the same space of
time, since the days of the Reformation. Jeremy White collected
a list of the names of Nonconformist sufferers, amounting to
sixty thousand, and he states that of these sufferers five thousand
died in prison. Informers skulked about cottages, garrets, back
rooms, stables, and outhouses, wherever they suspected a handful
of quiet Christians might be assembled to hear the word of life
from the lips of an old pastor; and despite curtains, shutters,
trap-doors, and other simple devices to ensure safety, seized on
their hapless victims, and dragged them before merciless magistrates,
who, with savage joy, doomed them to deep, dark prisons.
Some, in search of godly quietude, wandered far away, others
secreted themselves in fields and woods, but the more daring
remained in their former dwellings, and met to worship God, in
consequence of which they were led off to prison. Students,
deprived of all means of subsistence, had to lay aside their books,
take up the spindle, earn a few pence at knitting, and live on the
coarsest fare. Closets, beds, tubs, hay-ricks, and other places of
concealment were haunted by ruffian soldiers, pointing a musket
at the door, or thrusting a sword into the straw. Troopers
made no scruple of rushing into a good man’s house, while he
was at prayer, and of threatening, while holding a pistol at his
head, to blow out his brains, unless he ceased from his whining
cant.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were days of terror and of suffering such as Englishmen
now seldom think about. Thousands of disgraceful and heart-rending
facts might be stated. Suffice it to remark that, notwithstanding
the severity of law, the harshness of magistrates, the
brutality of constables, the deceitfulness of spies, and the rudeness
of the rabble, Nonconformists continued as numerous as ever.
Their firmness of character, their plain, practical, and awakening
ministry, the purity of their morals, their strict observance of the
Sabbath, their care for family religion, their succession of able
and learned preachers, the disgust at the persecutions they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>made to suffer, and the reaction produced by pushing High
Church principles to an unbearable extent, in the short space of
a quarter of a century, brought about the English Revolution of
1688, and obtained for them that which is the birthright of all,
liberty to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley began life amid all this royal perfidy, legalised
suffering, and national excitement, and, as we shall shortly see, he
was the son of one of the two thousand persecuted and martyr-like
ministers, ejected from their churches and their homes by the
tyrannic Act of Uniformity, passed and enforced in the year 1662.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br />PARENTAGE—1600–1670.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Samuel Wesley was the grandson of Bartholomew Wesley, rector
of Catherston, in Dorsetshire. Bartholomew Wesley was born
about the year 1600; but the place of his nativity is not known.
He received a university education, a fact indicating, to some extent,
the circumstances and the religious opinions of his parents.
Calamy informs us, that, while at the university, Bartholomew
Wesley applied himself to the study of physic, as well as of divinity;
and the knowledge which he acquired was of great advantage
to him in the dark days of his after life. In 1640 he was inducted
to the rectory of Charmouth, and in 1650 to that of Catherston;
both of which he held until his ejectment in 1662.</p>

<p class='c001'>Catherston and Charmouth are villages in the south-western
extremity of Dorsetshire; the former about a mile distant from
the latter. Catherston stands on an eminence, and Charmouth in
the valley adjoining it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like many others, Bartholomew Wesley was driven from his
rectories by the Act of Uniformity. After this, though he preached
occasionally, he had to support himself and his family by the
practice of physic. Calamy says he used a peculiar plainness of
speech, which hindered his being an acceptable, popular preacher.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing more is known of Bartholomew Wesley, except a story
related by Lord Clarendon, embellished by Anthony á Wood, and
retailed by Rapin and others. Wood calls him “the fanatical
minister, sometime of Charmouth, in Dorsetshire,” who, in 1651,
had like to have “betrayed Lord Wilmot and King Charles II.,
when they continued incognito in that county,” but Wood was
a man so bitter and intolerant that all he says ought to be received
with caution.</p>

<p class='c001'>The substance of the story, as given by Clarendon and others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>is as follows:—After the battle of Worcester, in 1651, Charles
II. wished to escape to France, and it was privately arranged
that the vessel, in which he was to cross the channel, was to be
near Charmouth on the night of September 22d. A man was
sent to engage for that night the best rooms at the inn, at Charmouth,
for a pretended wedding party, who wished to stop to
refresh themselves and horses. All this being arranged, the party
arrived at the inn, and were secretly assured that about midnight
the long boat, to take them to the vessel, would be at the place
appointed. The King and Lord Wilmot waited at the inn; and
Colonel Wyndam and his man Peters went to the sea-side to look
for the boat; but looked all night in vain. At break of day, they
urged the king and Lord Wilmot quickly to escape from Charmouth
for fear of treachery. The reason why the boat had not
come, as was agreed, was, because the wife of the man who had
charge of it suspected what was transpiring, and locked her
husband in his chamber, and would on no account permit him
egress. While Lord Wilmot was obtaining this information,
a blacksmith of the name of Hammet<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> was requested to shoe his
lordship’s horse. The smith, from the fashion of the shoes, declared
they had been made, not in the west, but in the north.
Henry Hull,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the hostler, hearing this, stated that the company,
of whom Wilmot was one, had sat up all night, and kept their
horses saddled. It was at once inferred, that the party who had
departed from Charmouth that morning, was either the king and
his friends, or some of the king’s distinguished adherents. The
hostler ran to Wesley, the minister, to ask his counsel. Wesley
was at his morning exercise, and being somewhat long-winded,
he wearied the hostler’s patience, who returned to the blacksmith’s
shop without telling his suspicions. In the meantime, Lord Wilmot
had mounted and was gone. The blacksmith then told Wesley
what had happened. Wesley went to the inn to make further
inquiries, and then went with the blacksmith to a magistrate, to
give him information, that warrants might be issued for the
apprehension of the suspected fugitives. No warrants, however,
were obtained; but a party pursued the king and his friends as far
as Dorchester, where the pursuit was ended.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the story in brief; but Clarendon adds that the day
when Charles and his friends were waiting at Charmouth was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>day appointed by the Parliament for a solemn fast, and that a
fanatical weaver, who had been a soldier in the parliamentary
army, was preaching against the king in a little chapel fronting
the obscure inn where his Majesty was stopping; that, to avoid
suspicion, Charles was among the weaver’s audience; and that
this was the man who hastened to make inquiries at the inn, and
that applied to a magistrate for a warrant.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley’s account of this affair is short. Like Clarendon, he
states, that the minister was a weaver, but omits to state that he was
his own great-grandfather. He writes:—“Pursuing his journey
to the sea-side, Charles once more had a very providential escape
from a little inn, where he set up for the night. The day had been
appointed by parliament a solemn fast; and a weaver, who had
been a soldier in the parliament army, was preaching against the
king in a little chapel fronting the house. Charles, to avoid suspicion,
was himself among the audience. It happened that a smith,
of the same principles with the weaver, had been examining the
horses belonging to the passengers, and came to assure the preacher
that he knew by the fashion of the shoes, that one of the strangers’
horses came from the north. The preacher immediately affirmed
that this horse could belong to no other than Charles Stuart, and
instantly went with a constable to search the inn. But Charles
had left before the constable’s arrival.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In a book entitled “Miraculum Basilicon,” by A. J., (Abraham
Jennings,) and published in 1664, there are a few other particulars,
in reference to this occurrence, possessed of some interest. The
author calls Wesley “the puny parson of the place, and a most
devoted friend to the parricides;” and designates the “morning
exercise” in which he was engaged, when the hostler went to him,
“his long breathed devotions, and bloody prayers.” Wesley having
heard the rumour about the travellers at the inn, went to the innkeeper
to make inquiries. The writer says, “Wesley, this pitiful
dwindling pastor, posted to the innkeeper, and with most eager blusterations,
catechised him concerning what travellers he had lodged
that night; from whence they came, and whither they would, and
what they did there? His suspicions being increased by the answers
he received, he went to Dr Butler, the next justice of the peace,
requiring a warrant, by which he would stir up the people and
the soldiers to endeavour the apprehending of the king. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>justice having refused to grant the warrant, Captain Massey, who
was in the neighbourhood, at once gathered as many soldiers as
he was able, and followed after the fugitives in the way towards
London, until he came to Dorchester; but, by a most divine instinct,
the king turned another way, crossing the country a
little beyond Bridport, and so escaped from his pursuer Captain
Massey!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr A. Clarke has, with great earnestness, endeavoured to make
it clear that Bartholomew Wesley was not the man who tried to
entrap King Charles; and, if Clarendon’s description was literally
correct, that the preacher was a weaver, there would be presumptive
evidence in favour of Clarke’s opinion. It is quite possible that
Wesley might have been in the parliamentary army; but, remembering
that he received his education in the Oxford University, it
is hardly probable that he was a weaver previous to his removal
there. The only reasonable way to reconcile Wood’s statement
that Wesley was the minister who informed, with Clarendon’s
assertion that the preacher was a weaver, is to suppose that, on
account of the smallness of his income, Bartholomew Wesley, like
many others, found it expedient to have a spinning-wheel, and to
weave his home-spun yarns into home-made cloths. Admit such
a supposition, and all difficulties vanish. Wesley might have been
in the army; in such a sense, he might be a weaver; and he
might be preaching, and might have King Charles in his Charmouth
congregation on the day already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr A. Clarke seems to be exceedingly unwilling to admit that
Bartholomew Wesley was guilty of an act so mean as that of
giving information concerning King Charles. As to the meanness
or merit of such an act, opinions will differ. We submit, however,
that, in such a case, Bartholomew Wesley only did his duty.
Probably he had been in the parliamentary army, and had fought
for the emancipation of his country from the perfidious thraldom
of the Stuart dynasty. He was now, by the authority of the parliamentary
government, the appointed clergyman of the two
parishes where he lived. Only twelve days before the attempt of
Charles to escape to France from Charmouth, the Parliament had
issued a proclamation, threatening those who concealed the king,
or any of his party; and on the very day when it was arranged
for the plan of escape to France to be carried out, that proclamation
had been published two miles hence, in the adjacent town of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Lyme. Let the reader bear all this in mind, and he will probably
conclude that Dr A. Clarke’s earnest attempt to clear Bartholomew
Wesley from the charge of giving information concerning the
royal fugitive, was a labour of love not needed; and that the
whole affair, instead of injuring the rector’s fair fame, is greatly
to his credit. He performed a duty, a painful duty; and for that
he deserves, not excuses, but thanks.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bartholomew Wesley, after being ejected from his church at
Charmouth, still continued to reside in the same village, and obtained
a livelihood by the practice of physic. He made no secret
of the fact that it was his intention and wish to capture the king;
and he jokingly told a gentleman that he was “confident that, if
ever the king came back, he would be certain to love long prayers;
for if he (Wesley) had not been at that time longer than ordinary
at his devotion, he would have surely snapt him.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> His were
days of strife, of change, of oppression, and of sorrow. He lived
to a good old age, for he survived his son John, whose death, in
1678, greatly affected him. He preached when he could, and administered
physic as far as he was able. A local historian writes
concerning the persecuted dissenting Christians in the west:
“They were rewarded with cruel mockings, bonds, and imprisonments;
they wandered in deserts and in mountains; and in dens
and caverns they hid themselves. In the solitudes of Pinney
they offered up their prayers, in a dell between two high rocks,
which have ever since been called the <em>Whitechapel</em> Rocks; and in
an old house at Lyme there was recently discovered an ingeniously
concealed oak staircase, capable of admitting only one person
at a time, which led to a small apartment that had been used as a
chapel.” In such places, Bartholomew Wesley joined his fellow-Christians
in the worship which they stealthily presented to Almighty
God. He and they have long since passed to the place
where “the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at
rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Samuel Wesley’s father was John, the son of the ejected rector
of Catherston and Charmouth, and was born about the year 1636.
Even when a boy at school, he had deep religious convictions and
feelings, and began to keep a diary of God’s gracious dealings with
him, which, with slight interruptions, was continued to the end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>life. That diary is now unfortunately lost, or at all events, if it
still exists, no one seems to know where it is.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the usual age he was entered a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford,
and, in due course of time, became M.A. At the period when
John Wesley matriculated, Dr John Owen, who was Cromwell’s
chaplain, filled the office of vice-chancellor, and treated the young
student with marked attention. Wesley was serious and diligent,
and applied himself particularly to the study of the Oriental languages,
in which he made great proficiency.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owen was elected vice-chancellor in 1652, when John Wesley was
about sixteen years of age, and continued in that high office until
1657, which was a few months before Wesley’s entrance upon the
ministry; so that it is not improbable that Wesley was at Oxford
during the whole of the administration of this distinguished man.
Owen found this ancient seat of learning in an exceedingly disordered
state. After withstanding a long siege, it had recently been
obliged to surrender to the parliament forces, and was now left so
desolate, that men said, in their excitement, it looked like Jerusalem
in ruins. Broken trees and trampled gardens were seen on every
hand. Sculptured stones and pictured windows lay shattered in
the grass. Nettles and brambles were growing round the walls
of colleges. The rich wood-work in the quadrangle of Christ
Church had been used for fuel. The halls had been turned into
granaries, and the colleges into barracks. So long had Mars
usurped the place of Minerva, and students been accustomed to
exchange cap for helmet, that the scholastic air had almost
vanished. “There was little or no education of youth. Poverty,
desolation, and plunder,—the sad effects of war,—were to be seen
in every corner.” To correct these evils, to curb the licentiousness
of the students, to maintain the rights of the university, and to
support its character for piety and learning, Owen set himself
most vigorously, and he happily succeeded. Anthony Wood describes
him as putting down “formalities and all ceremony, and as
undervaluing his office by going in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quirpo</i></span>, like a young scholar,
with powdered hair, snake-bone band strings, a large set of ribbons
pointed at his knees, and Spanish leather boots, with large
lawn tops, and his hat mostly cocked.” Be this as it might,
among the students Owen acted as a father. While he discountenanced
and punished the vicious, he encouraged and rewarded
the modest and the indigent; and, under his administration, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>whole body was reduced to good order, and contained a great
number of excellent scholars, and persons of distinguished piety.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this period, Dr Thomas Goodwin, distinguished for his
piety, learning, and industry, was president of Magdalen College;
George Porter, a man of great gravity, integrity, self-denial, and
charity, was Proctor of the University; Stephen Charnock was
Senior Proctor of New College; Ralph Button, whom Baxter
describes as “a most humble, worthy, godly man,” was Canon
of Christ Church; Thomas Cole, the tutor of John Locke, was
Principal of St Mary’s Hall; John Howe was Fellow of Magdalen
College; Dr Edmund Staunton, who was a living concordance
to the Bible, was President of Corpus Christi College;
Dr Wilkins, who married Cromwell’s sister, and was afterwards
Bishop of Chester, was Warden of Wadham College; Dr
Pococke, the greatest Oriental scholar of his time, was Professor
of Arabic. Such were some of the celebrated men who flourished
at Oxford at the time when John Wesley was a student
there. And among others who, during the same period, received
a part or the whole of their academical education in the same
university, may be mentioned:—William Penn, the celebrated
Quaker; Philip Henry, the eminent Nonconformist; Dr South,
so famed for his pungent sermons; Sir Christopher Wren, the
illustrious architect; Dr Whitby, the learned commentator;
Launcelot Addison, father to Joseph Addison, the essayist;
Bishops Spratt and Compton, who afterwards ordained John
Wesley’s son Samuel; Bishops Crewe, Cartwright, Hopkins, Ken,
Fowler, Wiseman, Hooper, Marsh, Huntingdon, Cumberland, Turner,
and Lloyd; Joseph Alleine, subsequently John Wesley’s companion
in tribulation; and Charles Morton, in whose academy Samuel
Wesley was afterwards a student. Such were the distinguished contemporaries
of Samuel Wesley’s father in Oxford University.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley first began to preach, among seamen, at Radipole, a
village about two miles distant from Weymouth. In the meantime
the vicar of Winterborn-Whitchurch died, and the people of
that parish wished Wesley to preach to them as a minister on probation.
He went; his ministry and life gave satisfaction to those
who invited him; he passed his examination before Cromwell’s
“Triers;” and, by the trustees, was appointed to the living.
This was in May 1658, when he was about twenty-two years of
age.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Winterborn-Whitchurch is a village about five miles from
Blandford, in Dorsetshire, and in 1851 had a population of 595.
The income of the living, when it was presented to John Wesley,
was about £30 a year. He was promised an augmentation of
£100 a year; but, on account of the many changes in public
affairs which soon afterwards took place, the promise failed in its
fulfilment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oliver Cromwell died four months after John Wesley was inducted
into this church benefice, and, as a consequence, the nation
became more distracted than ever. There was, in fact, no efficient
civil government, and the ruling power fell wholly into the hands
of the army. In 1659, what was called “The Committee of
Safety” was appointed, consisting of twenty-three persons, who
were ordered “to endeavour some settlement of affairs, by preparing
such a form of government as might best comport with a
free state and commonwealth.” The Committee agreed upon seven
articles:—1. That there should be no kingship. 2. That there
should be no single person as chief magistrate. 3. That the army
should be continued. 4. That there should be no imposition
upon conscience. 5. No House of Peers. 6. That the legislative
and executive powers should be in distinct hands. 7. That parliament
should be elected by the people. Inextricable confusion
followed. Plotter plotted against plotter, and the cleverest man
was he who could best act the hypocrite. General Monk and his
army wished for the restoration of Charles; but parliament and
the Committee of Safety <em>seemed</em> to be opposed to this; and there
was serious danger of a recurrence of civil wars. John Wesley
was a young man, twenty-three years of age, and for a time appears
to have sympathised with the party represented by the
Committee of Safety, and to have taken up the sword on their
behalf; but when Charles was restored to the throne of his
fathers, in 1666, the young soldier quietly submitted, and took the
oath of allegiance and loyalty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of these facts are referred to in the following conversation,
taken from Calamy’s “Nonconformists’ Memorial.” It may
be added, that Dr Gilbert Ironside had been rector of Steepleton
and Abbas Winterborn, parishes in Dorset, not far from where
the Wesleys lived. He was consecrated Bishop of Bristol about
the time of Charles’s restoration, and was informed that John
Wesley would not read the Liturgy. The bishop expressed a desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to see him. Wesley waited upon his lordship; and the following
catechetical interview took place:—</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> What is your name?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> John Wesley.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> There are many great matters charged upon you.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Mr Horloch acquainted me that it was your lordship’s
desire that I should come to you; and, on that account, I am
here to wait upon you.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> By whom were you ordained? or are you ordained?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I am sent to preach the gospel.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> By whom were you sent?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> By a church of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> What church is that?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> The church of Christ at Melcombe.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> That factious and heretical church!</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> May it please you, sir, I know no faction or heresy that
that church is guilty of.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> No! Did not <em>you</em> preach such things as tend to faction
and heresy?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I am not conscious to myself of any such preaching.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I am informed by Sir Gerrard Napper, Mr Freak, and
Mr Tregonnel of your doings. What say you?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I have been with those honoured gentlemen, who, being
misinformed, proceeded with some heat against me.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> There are the oaths of several honest men, who have
observed you.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> There was no oath given or taken. Besides, if it be
enough to accuse, who shall be innocent? I can appeal to the
determination of the great day of judgment, that the large catalogue
of matters laid against me are either things invented or
mistaken.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Did not you ride with your sword in the time of the
Committee of Safety, and engage with them?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Whatever imprudences in civil matters you may be informed
I am guilty of, I shall crave leave to acquaint your lordship,
that his Majesty having pardoned them fully, and I having suffered
on account of them since the pardon, I shall put in no other
plea, and waive any other answer.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> In what manner did the church you speak of send you
to preach? At this rate everybody might preach.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><i>Wesley.</i> Not every one. Everybody has not preaching gifts
and preaching graces. Besides, that is not all I have to offer to
your lordship to justify my preaching.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> If you preach, it must be according to order; the order
of the Church of England, upon an ordination.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> What does your lordship mean by an ordination?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Do not you know what I mean?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> If you mean that spoken of Rom. x., I had it.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I mean that. What mission had you?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I had a mission from God and man.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> You must have it according to law, and the order of
the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I am not satisfied in my spirit therein.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Not satisfied in your <em>spirit</em>! You have more new-coined
phrases than ever were heard of! You mean your conscience,
do you not?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> <em>Spirit</em> is no new phrase. We read of being “sanctified
in body, soul, and <em>spirit</em>,” but, if your lordship like it not so,
then I say, I am not satisfied in my <em>conscience</em>, touching the ordination
you speak of.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Conscience argues science, science supposes judgment,
and judgment reason. What reason have you that you will not be
thus ordained?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I came not this day to dispute with your lordship; my
own ability would forbid me to do so.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> No, no; but give me your reason.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I am not called to office, and therefore cannot be
ordained.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Why, then, have you preached all this while?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I was called to the <em>work</em> of the ministry, though not to
the <em>office</em>. There is, as we believe, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vocatio ad opus, et ad munus</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Why may you not have the office of the ministry?
You have so many new distinctions! oh, how you are deluded!</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> May it please your lordship, because they are not a
people that are fit objects for me to exercise office-work among
them.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> You mean a gathered church: but we must have no
gathered churches in England; and you will see it so. For there
must be unity without divisions among us; and there can be no
unity without uniformity. Well, then, we must send you to your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>church, that they may dispose of you, if you were ordained by
them.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I have been informed by my cousin Pitfield and others,
concerning your lordship, that you have a disposition opposed
to morosity. However you may be prepossessed by some bitter
enemies to my person, yet, there are others, who can and will give
you another character of me. Mr Glisson hath done it; and Sir
Francis Fulford desired me to present his service to you, and,
being my hearer, is ready to acquaint you concerning me.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I asked Sir Francis Fulford whether the presentation
to Whitchurch was his. Whose is it? He told me it was not
his.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> There was none presented to it these sixty years. Mr
Walton lived there. At his departure, the people desired me to
preach to them; and, when there was a way of settlement appointed,
I was by the trustees appointed, and by the Triers
approved.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> They would approve any that would come to them, and
close with them. I know they approved those who could not read
twelve lines of English.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> All that they did I know not; but I was examined
touching gifts and graces.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I question not your gifts, Mr Wesley. I will do you
any good I can; but you will not long be suffered to preach, unless
you do it according to order.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I shall submit to any trial you shall please to make. I
shall present your lordship with a confession of my faith, or take
what other way you please to insist on.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> No; we are not come to that yet.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I shall desire several things may be laid together, which
I look on as justifying my preaching:—1. I was devoted to the
service from my infancy. 2. I was educated thereto, at school and
in the university.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> What university were you of?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Oxon.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> What house?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> New Inn Hall.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> What age are you?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Twenty-five.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> No sure, you are not!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>Wesley.</i> 3. As a son of the prophets, after I had taken my
degrees, I preached in the country, being approved of by judicious,
able Christians, ministers, and others. 4. It pleased God to seal
my labour with success, in the apparent conversion of several souls.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Yea, that is, it may be, to your own way.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Yea to the power of godliness, from ignorance and profaneness.
If it please your lordship, to lay down any evidences of
godliness agreeing with the Scriptures, and if they be not found in
those persons intended, I am content to be discharged from my
ministry; I will stand or fall by the issue thereof.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> You talk of the power of godliness such as you fancy.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Yea, the reality of religion. Let us appeal to any
commonplace book for evidences of grace, and they are found in
and upon these converts.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> How many are there of them?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I number not the people.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Where are they?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Wherever I have been called to preach—at Radipole,
Melcombe, Turnworth, Whitchurch, and at sea. I shall add another
ingredient of my mission. 5. When the church saw the presence
of God going along with me, they did, by fasting and prayer, in
a day set apart for that end, seek an abundant blessing on my
endeavours.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> A particular church?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Yes, my lord. I am not ashamed to own myself a member
of one.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Why, you mistake the apostles’ intent. They went about
to convert heathens, and so did what they did. You have no warrant
for your particular churches.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> We have a plain, full, and sufficient rule for gospel
worship in the New Testament, recorded in the Acts of the Apostles
and in the Epistles.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> We have not.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> The practice of the apostles is a standing rule in those
cases which were not extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Not their practice, but their precepts.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Both precepts and practice. Our duty is not delivered
to us in Scripture only by precepts, but by precedents, by promises,
and by threatenings mixed. We are to follow them as they followed
Christ.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i>Bishop.</i> But the apostle said, “This speak I; not the Lord”—that
is, by revelation.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Some interpret that place, “This speak I now, by
revelation from the Lord”—not the Lord in that text before
instanced, when he gave answer concerning divorce. May it
please your lordship, we believe that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cultus non institutus est
indebitus.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> It is false.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> The second commandment speaks the same: “Thou
shalt not make unto thyself any graven image.”</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> That is, forms of your own invention.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Bishop Andrews, taking notice of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“non facies tibi,”</span>
satisfied me that we may not worship God but as commanded.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> You take discipline, church government, and circumstances
for worship.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> You account ceremonies a part of worship.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> But what say you? Did you not wear a sword in the
time of the Committee of Safety, with Demy and the rest of
them?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> My lord, I have given you my answer therein; and I
further say, that I have conscientiously taken the oath of allegiance,
and faithfully kept it hitherto. I appeal to all that are
around me.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> But nobody will trust you. You stood it out to the
last gasp.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I know not what you mean by the last gasp. When
I saw the pleasure of Providence to turn the order of things, I
did submit quietly thereto.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> That was at last.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Yet many such men are trusted, and now about the
king.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> They are such as, though on the parliament side during
the war, yet disown those latter proceedings; but you abode even
till Haselrig’s coming to Portsmouth.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> His Majesty has pardoned whatever you may be informed
of concerning me of that nature. I am not here on that
account.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I expected you not.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Your lordship sent your desire by two or three messengers.
Had I been refractory, I need not have come; but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>would give no just cause of offence. I think the old Nonconformists
were none of his Majesty’s enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> They were traitors. They began the war. Knox and
Buchanan in Scotland, and those like them in England.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I have read the protestation of owning the king’s
supremacy.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> They did it in hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> You used to tax the poor Independents for judging
folks’ hearts. Who doth it now?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I did not; for they pretended one thing and acted
another. Do not I know them better than <em>you</em>?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I know them by their works, as they have therein delivered
us their hearts.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Well, then, you will justify your preaching, will you,
without ordination according to the law?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> All these things laid together are satisfactory to me,
for my procedure therein.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> They are not enough.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> There has been more written in proof of preaching of
gifted persons, with such approbation, than has been answered by
any one yet.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Have you anything more to say to me, Mr Wesley?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Nothing. Your lordship sent for me.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I am glad I heard this from your own mouth. You
will stand to your principles, you say?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I intend it, through the grace of God; and to be faithful
to the king’s majesty, however you deal with me.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> I will not meddle with you.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Farewell to you, sir.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Bishop.</i> Farewell, good Mr Wesley.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a long conversation, but it is instructive and useful, (1.)
as casting light upon Church and State affairs, immediately after
the restoration of Charles; and (2.) as furnishing several interesting
facts in the history of Samuel Wesley’s father. Passing over
the first, we learn that John Wesley, like his grandson of the same
name, was a man of sound sense and pluck. He adhered to the
parliament and to the Commonwealth to the last moment; but
when he saw that the Commonwealth was doomed, and that the
nation was resolved to restore the Monarchy, like a man of sense,
he laid aside his sword and quietly submitted. His continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>firm adherence to the cause of the Commonwealth—“to the last
gasp,” as the bishop put it—brought him into trouble after the
king’s return; but royal clemency was properly exercised towards
him, and there was an end of the affair. He had preferred another
kind of government; but now that Charles, by the voice of the
nation, was seated upon the throne, Wesley took the oath of allegiance,
and faithfully kept it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is further evident, from the foregoing conversation, that John
Wesley was never episcopally ordained. From his infancy, he was
devoted, by his God-fearing father, to the work of the ministry,
and was educated in reference thereto, both at school and at college.
After leaving the university, he became a private member
of the church at Melcombe. Authorised by the voice of that
church, he began to preach at Melcombe, Radipole, Turnworth,
Whitchurch, and other places. By the bishop’s own admission,
he was a man of “gifts.” His preaching was the means of converting
sinners in every place in which it was exercised. Just at
this juncture, Mr Walton, who had been vicar of the parish of
Winterborn-Whitchurch for fifty-six years, died. Several able
ministers, and judicious Christians, thought young Wesley to be a
suitable successor. The trustees, in whom the presentation was
vested, offered him the living. Cromwell’s Triers, after having
examined him as to his fitness for the ministerial work, gave him
their certificate of approval. And then, as the last step previous
to his induction—instead of ordination by bishops or by presbyters—the
church of which he was a private member set apart a
day for fasting and prayer, to seek an abundant blessing on his
labours. Thus qualified, called, and commissioned, the young
evangelist, at the age of twenty-two, entered upon his ministerial
charge; and, laying aside the Liturgy, which had probably been
used by the previous vicar during his long ministry of fifty-six
years, he introduced the Presbyterian, or the Independent, form of
worship, and thereby involved himself in trouble. Some of the
parishioners—as Sir Gerrard Napper, Mr Freak, and Mr Tregonnel—disliked
the change; and, as soon as a bishop was appointed
after the Restoration, they lodged a complaint against their young
minister. It is extremely doubtful whether the bishop at that time—1661—had
authority to interfere in a case like Wesley’s; but he
wished to see him; and, accordingly, knowing that there was no
violation of law in his abandonment of the Liturgy during the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>three years, Wesley, with a fearless heart and unflinching face,
sought the bishop’s presence, and held the characteristic conversation
already given.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is somewhat difficult to determine what Wesley means by
his “gathered church,” and by its members not being fit for him
“to exercise <em>office-work</em> among them.” The probability is, that at
the death of old Mr Walton there were no really converted persons
in the parish, and, therefore, none whom Wesley deemed to
be fit and proper persons to receive the sacrament. His endeavour,
for the past three years, had been to get the people converted,
and, to some extent, he had succeeded; but still, he even
yet scarce considered his new converts, the members of his gathered
church, sufficiently instructed and established to justify him in his
exercising “office-work” among them; or, in other words, to
justify him in administrating to them the sacrament of the Lord’s
Supper. If this is not the meaning of this technical and obscure
verbiage, the reader, so far as the writer is concerned, must be
content to remain in ignorance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley’s conversation with Bishop Ironside occurred sometime
during the year 1661. About the same period he was arrested,
on the Lord’s-day, as he was coming out of church, and was
carried to Blandford, where he was committed to prison. The
reason of this arrest was exactly the same as that which brought
him before the Bishop of Bristol. He would not use the Liturgy.
His enemies had accused him to the bishop, but without effect, for
the bishop as yet was really without jurisdiction. King Charles
had appointed bishops to several dioceses, and the Liturgy had been
introduced into those churches, where the ministers were avowedly
Episcopalians; but it was not until the month of November 1661,
that the prayer-book was revised by Convocation; and it was not
until August 1662, that the use of it was made binding. It is
true that, during the summer of 1660, a bill had been passed by
parliament giving power to expel from church livings every incumbent
that had not been ordained by an ecclesiastic; and by
this act, John Wesley might have been expelled from the living
of Winterborn, Whitchurch. But this was not the ground taken by
Sir Gerrard Napper and the other parishioners who were inimical
to his person and ministry. Probably they were not aware, or
were not in a position to prove, that he had not received ordination;
and hence their illegal plot to imprison and expel him, because, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>conducting divine service in his church, he persisted in his refusal
to use the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was within two years after the restoration of Charles II.
that Wesley was arrested and committed to Blandford gaol on
such a charge. Sir Gerrard Napper had been his most furious
enemy, and the most forward in committing him; but after Wesley
had lain in prison for a length of time, Sir Gerrard broke his
collar bone, and, perhaps thinking that the disaster had happened
as a judgment upon him for his cruelty to the young minister, he
requested some of his friends to bail him, and told them, that
if they refused, he would give bail himself. At length, by an
order of the Privy Council, dated July 24, 1661, it was directed
that he should be discharged from his then imprisonment, upon
taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance. He was taken
accordingly before a magistrate, who, for some reason, declined
administering the oaths, but issued a warrant, dated July 29,
1661, commanding him to appear before the judges of the assizes,
to be holden at Dorchester, the 1st of August following.</p>

<p class='c001'>He has recorded in his diary the goodness of God in inclining
a solicitor to plead for him, and in restraining the wrath of man,
so that even the judge, though a man of sharp temper, spoke not
an angry word. The sum of the proceedings, as given in his diary,
is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Clerk.</i> Call Mr Wesley of Whitchurch.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Here.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Clerk.</i> You were indicted for not reading the common prayer.
Will you traverse it?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Solicitor.</i> May it please your lordship, we desire this business
may be deferred till next assizes.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Why till then?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Solicitor.</i> Our witnesses are not ready at present.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Why not ready now? Why have you not prepared for
a trial?<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><i>Solicitor.</i> We thought our prosecutors would not appear.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Why so, young man? Why should you think so?
Why did you not provide them?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i>Wesley.</i> May it please your lordship, I understand not the
question.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Why will you not read the Book of Common Prayer?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> The book was never tendered to me.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Must the book be tendered to you?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> So I conceive by the act.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Are you ordained?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I am ordained to preach the gospel.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> From whom?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I have given an account thereof already to the bishop.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> What bishop?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> The Bishop of Bristol.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> I say, by whom were you ordained? How long is it
since?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Four or five years since.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> By whom then?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> By those who were then empowered.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> I thought so. Have you a presentation to your place?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I have.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> From whom?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> May it please your lordship, it is a legal presentation.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> By whom was it?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> By the trustees.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Have you brought it?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> I have not.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Why not?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Wesley.</i> Because, I did not think I should be asked any such
questions here.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> I would wish you to read the common prayer at your
peril. You will not say, “From all sedition and privy conspiracy;
from all false doctrines, heresy, and schism. Good Lord, deliver
us!”</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Clerk.</i> Call Mr Meech.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Meech.</i> Here.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Clerk.</i> Does Mr Wesley read the common prayer yet.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Meech.</i> May it please your lordship, he never did, nor he never
will.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Friend, how do you know that? He may bethink
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Meech.</i> He never did; he never will.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><i>Solicitor.</i> We will, when we see the new book, either read it, or
leave our place at Bartholomew tide.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Judge.</i> Are you not bound to read the old book till then? Let
us see the act.</p>

<p class='c001'>The act was handed to the judge, and while he was reading it,
another cause was called; and John Wesley was bound over to
the next assizes. He came joyfully home, and preached each
Lord’s-day, till August 17, 1662, when he delivered his farewell
sermon to a weeping audience, from Acts xx. 32; “And now,
brethren, I commend you to God, and the word of his grace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the account given by Dr A. Clarke; an account taken,
in substance, from Calamy. Some of the dates are perplexing and
doubtful. Clarke states that this odd sort of assize trial took
place in August 1661; and yet from the last remark of the
Solicitor,—“When we see the new book we will either read it,
or leave our place at Bartholomew tide,” it is clear that the “new
book” was, to say the least, already sanctioned; and that the Act
of Uniformity was already passed, fixing Bartholomew tide as the
time when every possessor of a church living must either use the
“new Book” of Common Prayer, or be ejected from his church.
Admit this, and then it is undeniable that Wesley was tried at
the assizes, not in 1661, but in 1662; inasmuch as the “new
book” was not prepared by Convocation before November 1661;
and the Act of Uniformity, making the use of it binding, was not
passed before the 19th of May 1662.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> John Wesley was kept in
prison up to within a month of the mournful 24th of August,
when he and two thousand more were ruthlessly ejected from
their churches and their homes. At the very utmost, he would
not have the opportunity of preaching on more than three Sundays
in his church, before Sir Gerrard Napper and his other
enemies had their wishes gratified, by seeing him finally expelled.
There are some other difficulties in the account given by Calamy
and Clarke; but, in a life like this, they are scarcely worth
noticing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little more remains to be said concerning Samuel Wesley’s
father. Where he spent the first six months after his ejectment
from his benefice, we have no means of knowing. Probably, however,
he remained in the same village, where he had spent the
last four years, inasmuch as it was here that his son Samuel was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>born, only four months after the youthful minister and his wife
were cast out of their vicarage.</p>

<p class='c001'>On February 22, 1663, when Samuel Wesley was only nine
weeks old, his father and his mother removed to Melcombe.
Before their arrival, their old enemy, Sir Gerrard Napper, and
seven other magistrates, by some stretch of authority, had turned
out of office the mayor and aldermen of the borough, and had put
into their place others more subservient to their will. Accordingly,
when young Wesley and his wife, with their infant child,
reached Melcombe, they found that the new corporation had made
an order against their settlement in the town; and that if they persisted
in settling there, a fine of £20 was to be levied upon the
owner of the house in which they lived, and five shillings per
week upon themselves. Wesley waited upon the mayor and some
others, pleading that he had lived in Melcombe previously; and
offering to give security for his proper behaviour; but all was of
no avail, for, a few days afterwards, another order was drawn up
for putting the former one into execution.</p>

<p class='c001'>These violent proceedings drove John Wesley and his family
from the town, where, a few years before, he had lived beloved by
all who knew him. He now went to Ilminster, Bridgewater, and
Taunton, in all of which places, the Presbyterians, Independents,
and Baptists, treated him with great kindness, and where he
preached almost every day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The author of “Joseph Alleine: his Companions and Times,”
states that, from the 11th of March 1663 to the beginning of
May in that year, John Wesley was the “enthusiastic fellow-labourer”
of Joseph Alleine. Mr Sandford adds—“He” (Wesley)
“preached almost every day, dividing his time between Mr
Alleine’s people at Taunton and Mr Norman’s at Bridgewater;
he also occasionally ministered to congregations of Baptists and
Independents at both places.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alleine was one of the two thousand ministers ejected in 1662;
but he, at once, began to preach in his own house, and in surrounding
villages and towns, and generally delivered from seven to fourteen
sermons every week. He knew that, at any moment, he
might be dragged to prison, and this made him all the more diligent
and earnest in improving the time he had.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Norman, mentioned above, was another of the ejected
ministers. He had good natural abilities, and a considerable stock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of learning, and was an acceptable preacher. With Alleine, and
many others, he was sent to prison for venturing to preach the
gospel of his Lord and Master. “Sirrah,” said Judge Foster,
when Norman was arraigned before him in 1663, “Sirrah, do you
preach?” “Yes, my lord,” said Norman. “And why so, sirrah?”
“Because I was ordained to preach.” “How was you ordained?”
“In the same way as Timothy.” “And how was that?” “By the
laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.” Norman was sentenced
to pay a fine of £100, and to lie in prison till the fine was paid.
As he was being taken to Ilchester Gaol, the officers called at the
house of the High Sheriff. “Where is now your God?” tauntingly
asked the Sheriff’s wife. “Have you a Bible?” asked Norman.
“Yes,” said she. “Bring it,” said Norman. Being brought he
read Micah vii. 8, 9, 10. The poor woman seemed to be paralysed
with fear, and immediately retired; and the dealings of God with
the Sheriff’s family, not long after, caused this text to be remembered.</p>

<p class='c001'>This happened in the very month that John Wesley left his
friends Alleine and Norman, for before that month of May in 1663
expired, both Norman and Alleine were confined in Ilchester Gaol.
When Alleine started off to prison, both sides of the streets of
Taunton were lined with his weeping friends, and many followed
him several miles on foot, and made such lamentations after him
that they well-nigh broke his heart. Arriving at the prison gates,
and finding the gaoler absent, he took the opportunity of preaching
before he entered. He was clapped up in the Bridewell
chamber, over the common gaol, Where he found his friend Norman,
who had been committed a few days before him. In this low,
miserable garret, these godly companions of John Wesley spent both
day and night for many months. There were imprisoned with them,
in the same room, fifty Quakers, seventeen Baptists, and also thirteen
other ministers, all arrested, like themselves, for the high crimes of
preaching and praying. The atmosphere was stifling. The summer
sun struck fiercely on the roof all day, and so low was the covering
of the building, that at night, when lying on their mattresses, the
prisoners could touch the glowing tiles. Grasping for life, they had
sometimes to break the Windows, or to remove a tile for the purpose
of obtaining air. Night and day they were compelled to listen
to the songs, the curses, and the clanking chains of the felons in the
cells below; and if they ventured out of their deadly vapour-bath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>into the prison court, they were met by the sights of the loathsome
and pestilential wretchedness of the criminals that crossed
their paths.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was by a narrow escape that John Wesley was not put into
the same prison as his friends Alleine and Norman.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley having spent about six weeks at Bridgewater,
Taunton, and Ilminster, a gentleman who had a house at Preston,
near Weymouth, offered to allow him to live in it without paying
rent. Thither, therefore, he removed his young wife and their
infant child in the beginning of May 1663, and thus avoided imprisonment
with his friends whom he left behind. Excepting a
temporary absence, shortly to be noticed, he continued to reside
at Preston until his death in 1678.</p>

<p class='c001'>At one time he strongly wished to go as a missionary to
Surinam, a settlement in Guiana; and at another time, to Maryland,
in America—but in neither instance was his wish accomplished.
Probably the advice of his friends, and the expense of
such a journey, presented difficulties which he found impossible
to surmount.</p>

<p class='c001'>For awhile he seems to have been obliged to give up preaching;
and as there was no public worship except that of the Church of
England, in which the Liturgy was used, he was considerably
troubled at being debarred from joining in sanctuary service; but,
by reading Mr Philip Nye’s “Arguments for the Lawfulness of
hearing Ministers of the Church of England,” his scruples concerning
the Liturgy were so far removed that he was able, with a
safe conscience, to attend the church service.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length he began to preach in private to a few good people
in Preston, and occasionally at Weymouth, and at other places contiguous.
After some time, he had a call from a number of serious
Christians at Poole to become their pastor. He consented, and
continued in that capacity while he lived, administering to them
all the ordinances of God as opportunity offered. In consequence,
however, of the Oxford Five Mile Act, passed in 1665, he was
often put to great inconvenience. Notwithstanding all his
prudence in managing his meetings, he was frequently disturbed,
several times apprehended, and four times imprisoned—once at
Dorchester for three months, and once at Poole for half a year;
and once, at least, he was obliged to leave his wife, his family, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>flock, and for a considerable time to hide himself in a place of
secrecy. Again and again, the handful of godly people meeting in
the house of Henry Saunders, mariner, of Melcombe, were arrested
for being present at a conventicle, and were fined, imprisoned, or
otherwise punished. Dr Calamy adds, that John Wesley “was in
many straits and difficulties, but was wonderfully supported and
comforted, and was many times very seasonably and surprisingly
relieved and delivered. Nevertheless, the removal of many eminent
Christians into another world, who had been his intimate
acquaintance and kind friends, the great decay of serious religion
among many professors, and the increasing rage of the enemies of
real godliness, manifestly seized on and sunk his spirits; and he
died, when he had not been much longer an inhabitant here below
than his blessed Master was, whom he served with his whole heart,
according to the best light he had.” Application was made to the
vicar of Preston to have him buried in the church; but the application
was refused; and, in the churchyard, no stone tells where
his ashes lie, nor is there any monument to record his worth.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the concluding sentence of Dr Calamy, it would seem
that John Wesley died about the early age of thirty-three or
thirty-four. He left behind him two sons, Samuel and Matthew,
and a faithful wife, who remained his widow for about half a
century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Limited space forbids further details concerning Samuel Wesley’s
father; in fact, further details do not exist. John Wesley,
though young in years, evinced a mind elevated far above the
common level, even of those who have had the advantages of a
collegiate education. He was no unthinking zealot or timid
changeling. He had made himself master of the controverted
points between the Established Church and Dissenters, and his opinions,
being founded upon conviction, were held with the fidelity
of a martyr’s grasp. To say nothing of other facts, his interview
with the Bishop of Bristol displays the same sincere and zealous
piety, the same manly sense, and the same heroic yet respectful
boldness, which distinguished his son Samuel and his grandsons
John and Charles in after years. Dr A. Clarke adds, that from
the same conversation the reader may learn two important facts:—1.
That the grandfather of the founder of Methodism was a
lay-preacher. 2. That he was an itinerant evangelist. Indeed
we find in John Wesley’s history an epitome of the Methodism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>which sprang up, through the instrumentality of his grandsons
John and Charles; his mode of preaching, matter, manner, and
success, bearing a striking resemblance to theirs and to their coadjutors.</p>

<p class='c001'>We can only add, that a portrait of John Wesley is published
in the <cite>Methodist Magazine</cite> for 1840. The hair is long, and parted
in the middle. The forehead is capacious, the nose large, the eyes
soft and sweet, the face without whiskers, and the general expression
of the countenance highly sad and thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before leaving the parentage of Samuel Wesley, a few words
must be said concerning his mother. She was the daughter of
one distinguished man and the niece of another. Her father was
the Rev. John White, one of the three assessors of the Assembly
of Divines, and long known as “the Patriarch of Dorchester;”
a man whom Fuller describes as being grave without being
morose, and who, in the course of his ministry, “expounded the
Scriptures all over and half over again;” a man who had the command
of his own passions and of the purses of his parishioners;
for he was so much beloved by his people that, “he could wind
them up to what height be pleased.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John White was born at Stanton St John, in December 1574.
After two years of probation at Winchester school, he was admitted
perpetual fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1595. Here he took
his degrees in arts, was admitted into holy orders, and became a
frequent preacher in and about Oxford. In 1606, he obtained the
rectory of Trinity Church, Dorchester. About 1624, he and some
of his friends projected the new colony of Massachusetts, in New
England, and, after surmounting many obstacles, secured a patent.
The object was to provide an asylum for the persecuted fugitives,
who were not able to conform to the ceremonies and discipline of
the Church of England. White himself had scruples respecting
the worship and proceedings of the same church; and, in 1630, was
prosecuted by Archbishop Laud, in the High Commission Court,
for preaching against Arminianism and the ceremonies. He was
also a sufferer during the civil wars, a party of horse in the neighbourhood
of Dorchester, under the command of Prince Rupert,
having plundered his house and taken away his library. On this
occasion, he made his escape to London, and was appointed minister
of the Savoy. In 1640, he was one of the learned divines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>directed to assist in “a committee of religion,” appointed by the
House of Lords. In 1643, he was chosen to be one of the Westminster
Assembly of Divines. Two years after, he succeeded the
ejected Dr Featley as rector of Lambeth, and had assigned to him
the use of his predecessor’s library, until his own, carried away by
Prince Rupert’s soldiers, should be returned to him. In 1647, he
was offered the wardenship of New College but refused it, and, as
soon as possible, returned to his old flock at Dorchester, for whom
he had the greatest affection, and where he had passed the happiest
of his days. He died suddenly at Dorchester, July 21, 1648,
when John Wesley, who married his daughter, was only twelve
years old. John White was a man of great zeal, activity, and
learning; and even Anthony à Wood allows that he was “a most
moderate Puritan.” By his wisdom the town of Dorchester was
greatly benefited, and, for many years, he exercised a patriarchal
influence among the inhabitants; but, towards the end of his days,
factions and adverse opinions crept in among his flock, and a new
race sprung up, who either knew not or refused to acknowledge
the worth of this godly man. “Of such disrespect,” says Fuller,
“he was sadly and silently sensible.” He married the sister of Dr
Burgess, the great Nonconformist, who afterwards, being reclaimed
to the Church of England, wrote in its defence. The works of
John White are—1. “A Commentary upon the First Three Chapters
in Genesis;” 2. “A Way to the Tree of Life, discovered in sundry
Directions for the Profitable Reading of the Scriptures;” 3. “A
Digression concerning the Morality of the Fourth Commandment,”
printed and published with the preceding; 4. A few sermons.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mother of Samuel Wesley was the daughter of this distinguished
man. Probably she was his youngest child, as there
is evidence to show that she survived her father for more than
sixty years.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was the niece of another man of mark, the celebrated
Dr Fuller. Thomas Fuller was, in many respects, a remarkable
character. At the age of twelve, he was deemed fit for the studies
of the university, whither he was sent accordingly. When he
was three-and-twenty he was collated to a prebend’s stall in
Salisbury Cathedral. Soon after this, he became rector of Broad
Windsor, in Dorsetshire. At the age of thirty-three, he removed
to London, where he officiated as lecturer in the Savoy Church in
the Strand. After this, his life was chequered, but his pen was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>hardly ever idle. In succession he published his “Pisgah Sight
of Palestine,” “Church History of Britain,” “A Defence of it
against Dr Heylin,” “History of the Holy War,” “History of the
Worthies of England,” all in folio. He was appointed chaplain to
Charles II., was created doctor of divinity, and bid fair to become a
bishop, when he was seized with fever, of which he died in 1661.
His funeral was attended by two hundred of the clergy, showing the
high estimation in which he was held. His writings possess much
learning, wit, and humour, with an elaborate display of quaint conceit,
a quality highly thought of at the time he wrote, and which, in
him, appears to have been natural. He was an almost unequalled
punster, but sometimes met his match. Once, when attempting
to play off a joke upon a gentleman, whose name was Sparrowhawk,
he received the following retort:—“What,” said Fuller,
who was very corpulent, “what is the difference between an owl
and a sparrowhawk?” “It is,” replied the other, “<em>fuller</em> in the
head, <em>fuller</em> in the body, and <em>fuller</em> all over.” Thomas Fuller was
not only eminent for his learning, his writings, and his wit, but
also for his prodigious memory. He could repeat five hundred
strange and unconnected words after twice hearing them, and a
sermon verbatim after he had heard it once. He undertook, after
passing from Temple Bar to the farthest end of Cheapside and
back again, to mention all the signs over the shop doors, in regular
succession, on both sides of the streets, and to repeat the names
both backwards and forwards; and this almost incredible task he
performed with the utmost exactness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, then, were the father and the uncle of Samuel Wesley’s
mother. Of herself little is known. As already shown, her
father died when she was young. Her uncle died when her
husband was suffering imprisonment for conscience’ sake. Her
husband died about the early age of thirty-four, leaving her
nothing but his holy example, his loving prayers, and at least
two young children. How she obtained a living, in the early
years of her widowhood, there is no evidence to show; but,
in her later years, she was obliged to depend on the little help of
£10 per annum, which her son Samuel was accustomed to squeeze
out of his sadly too small Epworth income. The whole of her
married life was one continued scene of persecution; and the forty
years of her long and dreary widowhood, was an unceasing struggle
with poverty and its attendant pain. She was alive in 1710.—See
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Clarke’s “Wesley Family,” vol. ii. p. 144. Would that we knew
more of her suffering history!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br />SCHOOL DAYS—1662–1683.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Samuel Wesley was born at Winterborn-Whitchurch, at the
close of the year 1662. He was educated at the Free School, at
Dorchester, by Mr Henry Dolling, to whom, out of respect, he
dedicated the first work that he published.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Dorchester Free
School was built by Edward Hardy, of Wyke, near Weymouth,
about the year 1579. Young Wesley remained here until he was
a little more than fifteen years of age, when he was sent to an
academy in London. He continued in London until August
1683, when he had nearly arrived at the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps there is no period in English history more pregnant
with painful interest than the first twenty-one years of Samuel
Wesley’s life. He came into the world four months after that
dark day of St Bartholomew, when his father, and his grandfather,
and more than two thousand other godly ministers of
Christ, were ejected from their churches, and driven from their
homes. When he was yet a child, the great plague of London
swept away one hundred thousand of its inhabitants; and the
great fire made nearly the whole city a sightless heap of cinders,
from the Tower to Temple Bar. Taking advantage of the confusion
produced by these terrible events, the Covenanters in the
West of Scotland rose up, and demanded redress of their grievances,
and the removal of Episcopacy. Archbishop Sharp, exchanging
the crosier for the sword, took the field against them.
Forty were killed on Pentland Hills, and one hundred and thirty
taken prisoners. Ten were hanged in Edinburgh upon one gibbet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and thirty-five more were sent back to the west of Scotland,
and there hanged, in front of their own dwellings, the ministers
of the Established Church declaring them damned to all eternity
for their rebellion, and the archbishop employing his Episcopal
genius in the invention of a new infernal instrument of torture,
and spending his hours out of the sacred pulpit, not so much
in sacred exercises as in studying how to make “the boots”
excruciate the surviving associates of those executed men. Clarendon,
who had much to do with the passing of the Act of Uniformity,
was now deprived of the great seal, was accused of
treason, and obliged to flee to France for safety. Sir Matthew
Hale, Bishop Wilkins, and others, made an effort to have the
Presbyterians comprehended in the Established Church, and to
secure toleration for all the other dissenting sects; but the orthodoxy
of parliament was as intolerant as ever, and it was a common
saying at the time, that whoever proposed new laws about religion
ought to do it with a rope round his neck. The bishops and High
Churchmen continued to preach the divine right of kings and
passive obedience, and the court plunged more deeply than ever
into debauchery and sin.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1668, the Puritans and apprentices about Moorfields took
the liberty to pull down a number of brothels, and then to say,
with some significance, that having demolished the little ones they
ought not to spare the great one at Whitehall. Colonel Blood,
the villainous desperado, after nearly murdering Lord Ormond,
and after stealing the crown of England from the Tower, was not
only pardoned, but admitted into the privacy and intimacy of the
court, became a personal favourite of the king, was constantly
seen about the palace, and had granted to him, for his base and
bloody deeds, an estate in Ireland, worth £500 a-year. In 1673
the Test Act was passed, which provided that all who refused to
take the oaths, and to receive the sacrament, according to the
rites of the Church of England, should be debarred from public
employment. In 1677, Charles not only permitted his nephew,
the Prince of Orange, to come to England, but hastily made up a
marriage between the prince and his niece, Mary, the elder daughter
of James, the Duke of York, by Anne Hyde,—Charles alleging
that this measure was forced upon him by the jealous fears of the
nation, particularly since the Duke of York had declared himself a
Papist.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>In 1678, the year in which Samuel Wesley was sent to school
in London, the popish plot of Titus Oates was developed. Titus
was the son of an Anabaptist ribbon weaver. After acting as
chaplain to one of Cromwell’s regiments in Scotland, he took
orders in the Church of England, and obtained the living of Hastings
in Sussex.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Whilst discharging his sacred duties, he was
twice convicted of perjury. He was then appointed chaplain on
board a man-of-war, but was dismissed with added infamy. Two
years before the development of his plot, he was admitted into the
service of the popish Duke of Norfolk, and suddenly became a
Papist. He was now sent to a Jesuits’ College in Spain, from
which, in a short time, he was disgracefully expelled. He recrossed
the Pyrenees, and presented himself, as a mendicant, at the
gate of the Jesuit College, at St Omar. Here, for a while, he
lived among the students and novices, and was then cast out with
shame, and was obliged to return to England without cassock and
without coat. It so happened that, just at this juncture, Dr
Tonge, rector of St Michael’s, in Wood Street, London, was a
great Protestant alarmist. Titus obtained access to him, worked
upon his fears, and, by his means, was brought before the Privy
Council. Here, in a new suit of clothes and a sacerdotal gown, he
alleged that, by the authority of the pope, a number of Jesuits
were plotting the murder of the king, and of his brother James,
the Duke of York; that these Jesuits had £60,000 a-year at their
command, to assist in carrying out their murderous intentions; that
repeated commissions had been given to shoot the king, and that
the queen’s physician had been urged to poison him; that a
wager had been laid that the king should eat no more Christmas
pies, and that if he would not become R. C. (Rex Catholicus) he
should no longer be C. R. (Charles Rex;) that the Jesuits had been
the authors of the great fire in London, and were now concocting
a plan for the burning of Westminster, Wapping, and all the
ships upon the river; and that, with the full expectation that all
these things would be done, the pope had already, by a secret bull,
filled up all the bishoprics, and had made appointments to most
of the high offices of state.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Privy Council heard these statements of Titus Oates with
astonishment. Meanwhile, Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, who had
taken Oates’ depositions, suddenly disappeared from his house in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Westminster, and was found brutally murdered in a ditch near
Primrose Hill. The ghastly body was exhibited to many thousands,
who shuddered and wept at the sight of one whom they deemed to
be a Protestant martyr. The funeral was attended by an immense
procession, having at its head seventy Protestant divines, in full
canonicals. The panic spread, and Protestants, of all classes, conformists
and non-conformists, royalists and republicans, considered
their lives in danger. Titus Oates was summoned before parliament.
Lord Stafford and four other Catholic lords were committed
to the Tower. Common prisons were crammed with Papists. The
House declared “that there hath been, and still is, a damnable
and hellish plot, contrived and carried on by the popish recusants,
for assassinating the king, for subverting the government, and for
destroying the Protestant religion.” Titus Oates was proclaimed
the saviour of the nation, and had a pension awarded of £1200 a-year.
Charles yielded to the storm of agitation, and Catholics
were expelled from their seats in both Houses of Parliament,—seats
which were not regained, by their successors, for one hundred and
fifty years afterwards, until 1829. Titus Oates went further still,
and even accused the Queen of England, at the bar of the House
of Commons, of high treason, declaring that he himself had heard
her say, “I will no longer suffer such indignities to my bed; I
am content to join in procuring his death, and in the propagation
of the Catholic faith.” This accusation, however, was allowed to
drop; but Stayley, the banker, Father Ireland, the Jesuit, and five
other persons, were tried and convicted, and then executed at
Tyburn for their complicity with the alleged popish plot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Space forbids further details, except to add, that as soon as
King James ascended the throne, Titus Oates was thrown into
prison, and was tried for perjury in reference to his assertions
respecting the popish conspiracy. He was found guilty, and was
sentenced to be stripped of his clerical habit, to be pilloried in
Palace Yard, to be led round Westminster Hall, with an inscription
over his head declaring his infamy, to be pilloried again in
front of the Royal Exchange, to be whipped from Aldgate to
Newgate, and, after an interval of two days, from Newgate to Tyburn.
If he survived this horrible infliction, he was to be kept
close prisoner for life, and, five times a-year, he was to be brought
forth from his dungeon, and exposed in the pillory in different
parts of London.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The whipping, says Neal, was inflicted with a severity unknown
to the English nation. Dr Calamy tells us that he saw Oates at
the cart-tail from Newgate to Tyburn, and that his back, fearfully
swollen with the first whipping, looked as if it had been flayed.
He adds: “Oates was a man of invincible courage, and endured
what would have killed a great many others; and yet, after all,
he was but a sorry, foul-mouthed wretch.” Macaulay says:
“Whilst he was being whipped from Aldgate to Newgate, the
blood ran down in rivulets, and his bellowings were frightful to
hear. When brought out again, to be whipped from Newgate to
Tyburn, it was necessary to drag him to Tyburn on a sledge. A
person who counted the stripes on this second day, said that they
were seventeen hundred.” The whipping was so terribly cruel,
that it was evidently the intention of the court to kill him; but,
by the care of his friends, he recovered. During many months,
he remained ironed in the darkest hole in Newgate, sitting whole
days, uttering deep groans, with his arms folded, and his hat
over his eyes. He lived to the reign of King William, when
a pension of about £300 a-year was settled on him,—a sum
which he thought unworthy his acceptance, but which he took
with the savage snarl of disappointed greediness. About the year
1698, he was restored to his place among the Baptists; but, in a
few months, was ejected from their communion as a disorderly
person and a hypocrite. He died in 1705.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to return. Such was the excitement created by Oates’s
allegations, that, in 1679, one of the first acts of the House of
Commons was to pass a resolution, “that the Duke of York, being
a Papist, and the hopes of his coming such to the crown, had
given the greatest countenance to the present conspiracies and
designs against the king and the Protestant religion.” The House
also voted an address to the king, requesting him to banish all
Papists in London twenty miles from its borders, and to put all
sea-ports, fortresses, and ships into trusty hands. In the meantime,
Charles induced his unpopular popish brother to retire to
Brussels; but, before he went, James exacted from the king a
formal declaration that the young Duke of Monmouth was illegitimate.
The Commons, not satisfied with what they had already
done, proceeded with their famous Bill of Exclusion, by which
the crown of England was to pass from Charles to the next <em>Protestant</em>
heir, as if the Duke of York were dead. This bill was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>read a second time, when Charles suddenly dissolved parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whilst all this was going on in England, exciting events were
occurring in Scotland. There, dragoons were dispersing field-meetings,
and many a moor was made wet with the blood of
Covenanters. At one field conventicle, upwards of one hundred
men were killed in cold blood. Balfour had mortally wounded
Archbishop Sharp; and Russell had finished the work by hacking
his skull to pieces; while the rest of their companions retired to
a cottage on the moor, and spent the remainder of the day in
thanksgiving to Almighty God for the accomplishment of a work
so glorious. The Duke of Monmouth was sent, with five thousand
troops, to put an end to a state of things like this; and the battle
of Bothwell Bridge was fought. Then James, Duke of York, succeeded
him, and exercised the functions of a Viceroy, under the
title of “King’s Commissioner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Shortly after the battle of Bothwell Bridge, a band of the most
enthusiastic of the Covenanters rallied round a man called Cameron,
a preacher, from whom they derived the name of Cameronians.
Cameron affixed to the market-cross of Sanquhar “A Declaration
and Testimony of the true Presbyterian, anti-prelatic, anti-erastian,
and persecuted party of Scotland.” In this document, he renounced
and disowned Charles Stuart, and declared war against him as a
tyrant and usurper. Cameron, with a mere handful of men, was
surprised by three troops of dragoons, and, with his brother and
ten of his followers, died fighting. A few escaped with Cargill,
another preacher, who, at Torwood, pronounced excommunication
against Charles II., king of Scotland, for his mocking of God, his
perjury, adultery, incest, drunkenness, and dissembling with both
God and man. Cargill was taken prisoner on July 26, 1681, and,
with four of his followers, was the next day hanged. Farther proceedings
followed. Lord Belhaven was imprisoned; and the Earl of
Argyle was committed on the charge of treason, but escaped from
a murderous death by escaping from his dungeon. Covenanters,
Cameronians, and all who were suspected of associating with them,
or of rendering them merciful assistance in their hour of need,
were punished. Courts of judicature, with their “boots” and
other instruments of torture, were set up, both in the south and
west of Scotland. Above two thousand persons were outlawed;
and the soldiers were authorised to shoot all delinquents refusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>to renounce Cameron’s and Cargill’s declarations. Thousands of
Presbyterians, who had taken no part with these desperate enthusiasts,
began to think of emigrating to America.</p>

<p class='c001'>In June 1683, the famous Rye-House Plot against Charles’s life
was unfolded. The Duke of Monmouth immediately absconded,
showing a delicate regard for his own safety, and a cowardly disregard
for the safety of his friends. William Lord Russell was
committed to the Tower. Howard, his relative, was discovered
hidden in a chimney; was taken in his shirt, and carried before
the Council; where the kneeling, puling, sobbing caitiff made such
confessions as led to the immediate arrest of the Earl of Essex,
Algernon Sydney, and Hampden, who were sent to join Lord
Russell in the Tower. Many others, Scots as well as English,
were arrested, and were true, to the edge of the axe, to their
friends and party. When Baillie, of Jerviswoode, was offered his
life if he would turn evidence, the proud Scot smiled, and said,
“They who make such a proposal know neither me nor my
country.” The steps taken by the authorities produced a different
effect upon others. The magistrates of London and of Middlesex
were terrified into loyalty, and presented petitions, praying for the
suppression of dissenting conventicles; for justice upon “atheistical
persons, rebellious spirits, infamous miscreants, and monsters;”
and for the condign punishment of those “execrable villains and
traitors” convicted of a design against his Majesty’s precious life.
A month after his arrest, Lord Russell was brought to trial; and,
on the same day, the Earl of Essex either committed suicide, or
was murdered by the procurement of the king and the Duke of
York. The base Howard was the principal witness against Russell.
The Earl of Bedford offered to the king £100,000, if he
would release his son; but Charles replied, “If I do not take his
life, he will soon take mine.” And, accordingly, on July 21,
attended by Tillotson and Burnett, the unfortunate Russell was
led to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and was beheaded. On the same day,
the University of Oxford published its decree in support of passive
obedience, or the right of kings to govern wrong, without resistance
or challenge from their suffering subjects. Seven weeks
after, Algernon Sydney was brought to trial before Judge Jeffries,
the legal bravo, who was as bold with his law books as Charles’s
other personal favourite, Colonel Blood, was with pistols, daggers,
and dark lanterns. Lord Howard was again the chief witness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and Sydney, on the 8th of December, was decapitated on Tower
Hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>This brings us down to the time when Samuel Wesley’s school
days ended; and, with this brief survey of the reign of Charles II.,
we must content ourselves, only adding a few remarks respecting
the morals of this disgraceful period of English history.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Restoration brought with it a tide, not only of levity, but
of licentiousness;—an inundation of all the debaucheries of the
French court, in which Charles and his followers had chiefly spent
their exile. The passions and tastes of the people, which, under
the rule of the Puritans, had been sternly repressed, and, if gratified
at all, had been gratified by stealth, now broke forth with ungovernable
violence; and, as soon as the check was withdrawn,
men flew to frivolous amusements, and to criminal pleasures, with
the greediness which long and enforced abstinence naturally produces.
Little restraint was imposed by public opinion; and there
was no excess which was not encouraged by the ostentatious profligacy
of Charles, and of his favourite courtiers. It is an unquestionable,
and a most instructive fact, that the years during
which the political power of the Anglican hierarchy was in the
zenith, were precisely the years during which national virtue was
at the lowest point.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Swearing and profligate conversation were now so prevalent,
that a young nobleman or man of family, was accounted no gentleman,
that allowed two hours to pass in company without inventing
some new modish oath, or without laughing at the
fopperies of priests, or without making lampoons and drolleries on
the Holy Bible. In the highest ranks, talent was employed in bedizening
the carrion carcase, and rouging the yellow cheeks of the
foul goddess of wantonness. Worthless actresses, and royal and
noble concubines, became the <a id='corr62.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pratronesses'>patronesses</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_62.31'><ins class='correction' title='pratronesses'>patronesses</ins></a></span>, and even the wives of
the highest nobility. Gaming was a fashionable phrenzy, and a
noble house was incomplete without a basset-table. Court ladies
became so equivocal in character, that few cared to venture the
selection of a wife from among them. Mrs Jenyngs, a maid of
honour, afterwards Duchess of Tyrconnel, dressed herself like an
orange wench, and cried oranges about the streets. Gentlemen
arrayed themselves like ladies, and ladies disguised themselves like
gentlemen, Duelling was of daily occurrence. Members of Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>adjourned to refresh themselves at taverns, from which
they returned half drunk to finish their senatorial discussions.
Younger sons of good families, heirs of wealthy citizens, and raw
young country squires huzzaed for the king, and then broke the
king’s peace, to show their love for him; scoured the streets in
nocturnal bands; stormed taverns; broke windows; wrenched off
door-knockers; daubed and defaced tradesmen’s signs; routed
apple-merchants, fishmongers, and butter-women; attacked and
knocked down all chance passengers; and generally ended by a
conflict with the watch. Gallantry was general, from the half-fledged
stripling fresh from the teacher’s rod, to the hoary-headed
veteran, whose dim eyes could scarcely see the charms with which
his heart was smitten. Foppery in dress resulted, and gallants
endeavoured to make themselves irresistible by the newest cut of
a French suit, or an enormous fleece of periwig.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, amid all this profligate frivolity of the higher classes, the
bulk of the community retained much of the old English spirit.
Many still adhered to the primitive hours of their forefathers for
going to bed, getting up, and transacting business. In diet, notwithstanding
the French cookery that had become prevalent, they
stoutly stood by old English fare. The people, also, were intensely
musical, and almost every person of education could sing
by the scale, and play upon some kind of instrument. These
were days, when the banks of the Thames were as melodious as
the shores of the Adriatic. In the country, the baronial table was
still heart of oak, and was laden with the old festive hospitality.
Huge sirloins and mighty plum-puddings seemed to laugh to
scorn the continental innovations that had become so fashionable
in the capital. Country squires gave landlord-feasts to their
tenants; while farmers gave harvest-homes and sheep-shearings to
their labourers. Swimming, foot-racing, skating, horse-racing,
bear and bull-baiting, tennis, and bowls were the people’s favourite
out-door sports; whilst cards, billiards, chess, backgammon, cribbage,
and ninepins, furnished amusement within. On Valentine’s
day, gentlemen sent presents of gloves, silk stockings and garters,
to their fair valentines; and, on the morning of May-day, young
ladies, and even grave matrons, repaired to the bright green fields
to gather dew to beautify their complexions; while milk-maids
danced in the public streets, their milk-pails wreathed with garlands,
and a fiddler playing tunes before them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The age was light-hearted, frivolous, and wicked; and yet there
flourished in it some of the greatest men that England has ever
had. Abraham Cowley, replete with learning, was embellishing
his poetic pages with all the ornaments that books could furnish
him. Samuel Butler, marvellously acquainted with human life,
was furnishing, in the grossly familiar versification of his “Hudibras,”
sententious distiches and proverbial axioms for the use of
future generations. Edmund Waller was honoured as the most
elegant and harmonious versifier of his time. Dryden’s prolific,
but extremely licentious pen, displayed a versatility of talent
almost without parallel. Otway wrote some of the most pathetic
tragedies in the English language, and terminated a miserable life
at the early age of thirty-four. Ralph Cudworth was employing
his extensive learning and profound philosophy in the production
of his “True Intellectual System of the Universe.” Henry More
was weeping over the miseries of his country, and studying how to
check the Atheism of Thomas Hobbes. Isaac Barrow was labouring
for words to express the amplitude and energy of his thoughts,
often preaching sermons three hours long, and immoderately using
tobacco as his “panpharmacon” to compose and regulate his mind.
John Bunyan was preaching his wondrous sermons when out of
prison; and, when in it, making tagged laces for a livelihood,
and writing his “Pilgrim’s Progress.” Peter Lely was commanding
admiration and acquiring a fortune by his portrait-painting;
and Christopher Wren, a great philosopher, and one of the most
eminent of architects, was drawing plans for rebuilding London
and St Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was amid such events, in the midst of such profligacy, and
surrounded by such men, that Samuel Wesley spent his school-days’
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Young Wesley remained at the Free School, Dorchester, until
he was fifteen years of age. For some time past, his father had
been dead. His mother was a widow, and was poor. The boy,
as he himself tells us, “was almost fit for the university,” but the
difficulty was to find means to send him there. Like his father,
and his two grandfathers, he was evidently intended for the
Christian ministry; but, considering the treatment which all the
three had experienced at the hands of the Episcopal party, it is
scarcely probable that their youthful descendant would, at this
early period of, his history, feel a wish to enter the ministry of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the Established Church. His father and his grandfathers, though
they had all been the occupants of Church livings, were, so far as
Episcopacy and the use of the Liturgy are concerned, Dissenters;
and there can be no question, that, as a boy fifteen years of age,
his sympathies were with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, had it been otherwise, there was little prospect of a youth
like him being able to become a minister of the Established Church.
To become such, he must receive Episcopal ordination; and to
receive that, he must go to the university: but to go there was
impossible, for he was without money, and was without Episcopal
friends to send him.</p>

<p class='c001'>His Dissenting friends showed him kindness. Without any
application being made to them, either by his mother or by himself,
they sent him, at their own cost, to London, for the purpose
of being entered at one of their private academies, and of being
trained for the Dissenting ministry. He tells us that Dr G. had
the care of one of the most considerable of these seminaries, and
had promised him tuition; but, on his arrival in London on the
8th of March 1678, he found that Dr G. was just deceased, and
so his hope for a time was thwarted.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was now sent to a grammar-school, where his progress
was such, that the master wished him to proceed to the university,
and actually promised him a handsome subsistence there. At
this crisis, his Dissenting friends again came forward. He was
a youth of promise; and, for their own sake, as well as out
of respect for his dead father, they were unwilling to have him
wrested from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this time, a fund existed, raised by the collections and subscriptions
of a certain Dissenting congregation, for the purpose of
meeting cases like that of young Wesley. Out of this fund, he
was granted an exhibition of £30 a year; and was sent to Mr
Veal’s academy at Stepney. Wesley says that his relatives considered
the offer of the Dissenters to possess greater advantages
than the offer which was made to him by the master of the
grammar-school to send him to the university, but in what respect
it was considered more advantageous we are left to guess.</p>

<p class='c001'>Edward Veal, the principal of the Stepney Academy, was, in
the first instance, a student of Christ’s Church College, Oxford,
and afterwards of Trinity College, Dublin. He was ordained at
Winwick, in Lancashire, August 14, 1657. When he left Ireland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>he brought with him a testimonial of his being “a learned, orthodox
minister, of a sober, pious, and peaceable conversation; who, during
his abode in the college, was eminently useful for the instruction
of youth, and whose ministry had been often exercised in and
about the city of Dublin with great satisfaction to the godly, until
he was deprived of his fellowship for nonconformity to the ceremonies
imposed in the Church, and for joining with other ministers
in their endeavours for a reformation.” This testimonial
was signed by seven respectable ministers, one of whom was the
celebrated Stephen Charnock, at that time exercising his ministry
in Dublin, and residing in the house of Sir Harry Cromwell. On
leaving Ireland, Edward Veal became chaplain to Sir William
Waller, in Middlesex, and afterwards settled as a Nonconformist
minister at Wapping, and likewise opened the academy at Stepney.
He died June 6, 1708, aged seventy-six. Four of his sermons are
published in the “Morning Exercises.” Dunton says he “was an
universal scholar, and a man of great piety and usefulness. His
principles were very moderate. He assisted in preparing for the
press the posthumous works of Stephen Charnock;” and wrote the
annotations on the Epistle to the Ephesians, published in the
Commentary of Matthew Poole.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley was a student in Mr Veal’s academy for about
the space of two years, during which his tutor read to him a course
of lectures on Logic and Ethics. He was now eighteen years of
age; and, as he himself tells us, “was a dabbler in rhyme and
faction, and had already printed several things with the Party’s”
(the Dissenters) “imprimateur.” His patrons were evidently satisfied
with his behaviour and his progress, for, before the two years
spent at Veal’s academy had expired, he received an additional
bonus of £10 per annum from the hands of Dr O(wen,) who
encouraged him in the prosecution of his studies, and advised him
to have a particular regard to critical learning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Veal was so annoyed and prosecuted by the neighbouring
magistrates that he broke up his academy, and relinquished the
office of a tutor. In consequence of this, young Wesley was again
cast afloat, and he was now recommended to the academy of Mr
Charles Morton, of Newington Green, where he remained until
the summer of 1683.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles Morton, M.A., of Wadham College, Oxford, was a
descendant from an ancient family at Morton, in Nottinghamshire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the seat of T. Morton, secretary to King Edward III. He
was born about the year 1626. His father was rector of Pendavy,
(Pendene-Vau?) in Cornwall; and his two brothers, also, were
ministers. When about fourteen years of age, his grandfather,
who was a stanch royalist, sent him to Oxford, where he was
exceedingly studious, and, at the same time, zealous for the rites
and ceremonies of the Established Church. He now began, however,
to apply himself seriously to the controversy between the
Prelatists and the Puritans; and, after mature reflection, joined
himself to the latter. While a fellow of the college, he was highly
esteemed by Dr Wilkins on account of his mathematical genius.
This was no small honour, for Wilkins was the brother-in-law of
Oliver Cromwell, was the warden of Wadham College, and, in
after years, became the founder of the Royal Society, and, in 1668,
was raised to the see of Chester. Morton began his ministry in
Oxford, and here for several years he lived as a Conformist. After
his ejectment by the Act of Uniformity, he resided in a small tenement
of his own in the parish of St Ives, and preached privately
to a few people in a neighbouring village. Having sustained a
large loss by the great fire of London, he removed thither to watch
over his affairs. Several of his friends prevailed with him to open
an academy at Newington Green. Here he had many pupils, who
became exceedingly useful both in Church and State. Scores of
young ministers, as well as many others who were eminent for
scholarship, were educated by him. He was in all respects an
excellent man; but this failed to save him from persecution.
During the time that young Wesley was his pupil, he was obliged
to leave his school and to hide himself. Wesley writes: “He had
once before been excommunicated, and a capias issued out against
him, on which he was taken. But while in custody of an officer,
in whose house he was kept previous to being sent to prison, the
officer died; and there being none to detain him, he returned
home again. He was now in danger of a second capias, on which
he used the mediation of my Lady R. to get some respite, and
sent his sister several times to London House on the same errand.
My Lord of L. promised him all reasonable favour if he would
leave Newington Green and his employment; but he could not
suffer him to continue in that, because it was so much to the
detriment and prejudice of the Established Church, and so much
an affront to the laws and universities. This threat caused Mr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Morton to abscond some time at a friend’s, absenting himself from
us, and leaving the senior pupils to instruct the junior.” After
about twenty years’ continuance in the office of a tutor, he was so
harassed with legal processes from the Bishops’ Court that he was
obliged to relinquish his academy; and, in 1685, two years after
Samuel Wesley left him to go to the Oxford University, he went
to America, where he was chosen pastor of a church at Charleston,
and became vice-president of Harvard College. Here he died
in 1697, at the age of about seventy-one. He was a man of a
sweet natural temper, and of a generous public spirit, an indefatigable
friend, pious, learned, ingenious, useful, and beloved by all
who knew him. He published nearly twenty treatises and other
works,—all of them, however, compendious, for he was an enemy
to large volumes, and used to say, “A great book is a great evil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dunton states, that his “high character led many of the persecuted
Nonconformists to join him in America. He was the very
soul of philosophy, the repository of all arts and sciences, and of
the Graces too. His discourses were not stale or studied, but
always new; high, but not soaring; practical, but not low. His
memory was as vast as his knowledge. He was as far from ignorance
as from pride; and, if we may judge of a man’s religion by
his charity, he was a sincere Christian.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley himself says: “Mr Morton was an ingenious
and universally learned man; but his chiefest excellency lay in
mathematics. He had many gentlemen of estate, who paid him
well; but he thought more of the glory of God than of his own
private profit. He only wished to save himself harmless; and,
therefore, if he had little for some, he valued it not, so as it was
barely made up by others, and he could send out new ministers
to be ordained by presbyters.” While, however, Mr Wesley speaks
so commendably of Mr Morton, his language is widely different in
reference to Mr Morton’s pupils. He writes: “The pupils entertained
a mortal aversion to the Episcopal order; and there were
but very few but what abhorred monarchy itself. The king-killing
doctrines were generally received and defended.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On one occasion some of the students went out at midnight to
a little hill not far from Newington, and, with a speaking trumpet,
alarmed the town, and then, through the trumpet, bellowed scandalous
stories respecting the clergyman of the place, the Rev.
Mr S.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Those among them who composed the bitterest and most ill-mannered
sarcasms on the public prayers and liturgy of the Church,
were caressed, hugged, encouraged, and commended by the heads
of the Dissenting party, Wesley himself sharing in the applause
awarded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The students, also, were in the habit of reading “the most lewd,
abominable books that ever blasted Christian eye;” but it is right
to add, that this was done without the knowledge of their tutors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Morton’s was the principal Dissenting academy in the land,
containing forty or fifty pupils, and having annexed to it “a fine
garden, a bowling-green, a fish-pond, and a laboratory furnished
with all sorts of mathematical instruments.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The two gentlemen under whose care Samuel Wesley was placed
in London were men of learning, of piety, and of general excellence;
and well would it have been if he had had no worse advisers
than these; but he writes: “Some of their (the Dissenters)
gravest, eldest, and most learned ministers encouraged me in my
silly lampoons, both on Church and State. They gave me subjects,
and furnished me with matter; some of them transcribed my
writings, and several of them revised and corrected them before
they were printed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley began to write his “silly lampoons” soon after he came
to London. Some of his first squibs were thrown at a worthy
man, who deserved more respectful treatment, both from him and
some others. The Rev. Thomas Doolittle, whom he wantonly
attacked, was a man of distinguished merit. Born at Kidderminster
in 1630, and educated in the College of Pembroke Hall,
Cambridge, he was, for nine years, the incumbent of the parish of St
Alphage, London. After being ejected by the Act of Uniformity,
he opened a boarding school, and, though against the law, a meeting-house
in Bunhill Fields. Here he preached to a numerous
congregation, and had many seals to his ministry, until at length,
on a Saturday, at midnight, the train bands came to arrest him;
but he managed to escape. Next morning, while another person
was preaching for him, the soldiers rushed into the chapel, and
the officer, addressing the preacher, shouted, “I command you, in
the king’s name, to come down.” The preacher replied, “I command
you, in the name of the King of kings, not to disturb His
worship, but to let me go on.” The officer ordered his men to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>fire. The undaunted preacher clapped his hand upon his heart,
and said, “Shoot, if you please; you can only kill the body.”
Great confusion followed, in the midst of which the brave-hearted
preacher escaped; but Doolittle’s pulpit was pulled to pieces,
and the doors of his meeting-house were fastened, and were
branded with the king’s broad arrow. After this Doolittle opened
a private academy at Islington, where, among other distinguished
pupils, he had the care of Matthew Henry, the author of the most
practical Commentary on the sacred Scriptures ever published;
and also of Edward Calamy, the well known writer of the
“Nonconformists’ Memorials.” It was at this time that Mr
Doolittle published his work entitled, “The Lord’s Last Sufferings,”
and prefixed to it a copy of Greek verses. Doolittle’s
academy at Islington, and Veal’s at Stepney, seem to have been
sworn enemies to each other, and eagerly longed for an opportunity
to display their prowess in academic conflict. For want of
a more proper subject, they made the verses, prefixed to Doolittle’s
book, the occasion of the clash of arms; and, as young Wesley was
already “celebrated for his vein at poetry,” he took, as Dunton
tells us, a prominent part in a skirmish, which seems to have been
wantonly begun, and not too honourably carried on. The squibs
which Wesley published are lost—a thing not to be regretted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Doolittle was far too good a man to be lampooned by the clever,
impertinent striplings belonging to a neighbouring school; but
the man whose goods had been seized and sold, and whose house
and person had been threatened by persecuting foes, was not likely
to be crestfallen on account of the pretentious swagger of young
Wesley and his coxcomb companions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another of Wesley’s lampoons, written while he was at Morton’s
Academy, was directed against Dr Williams, Bishop of
Chichester, a man whom Dunton describes as “of solid worth
and distinguished goodness.” Wesley says he was requested
to write his satire against Williams by a Dissenting minister
of no mean fame, and that the occasion of it was as follows:—A
man, killed by a mob, had been buried, and Williams had
ordered his body to be taken up, that a coroner’s inquest might
be held upon it. Wesley knew nothing of the affair himself, but
obtained full instructions from a minister near Clapham, who also
gave the young Horace a guinea or two for encouragement. The
lampoon was written, and Dr Williams, together with the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>order of bishops, abused to the very utmost of the young poet’s
power, while his juvenile satirical performance, as he tells us, “was
sufficiently applauded” by the unwise and dishonourable ministers
who had prompted him to undertake such a work. The bishops
of that period might not be as praiseworthy as was desirable; but
it was a mean action for Christian ministers to do dirty work by
proxy, and to employ a young fellow, cleverer than themselves, to
write a pasquinade which, perhaps, they had not the ability to
write.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this was discreditable, both to young Wesley and to his prompters;
but there was something else, which, but for his own good
sense, might have been even worse. In the same year that Samuel
Wesley was born, Biddle, “the father of the English Unitarians,”
died. Biddle had been the master of the Free School of St Mary
de Crypt, in Gloucester, and had adopted the Unitarian doctrines
respecting the Trinity. Among other works embodying his creed,
he published a tract, entitled, “Twelve Arguments, drawn out
of the Scriptures, wherein the commonly-received opinion touching
the Deity of the Holy Spirit is clearly and fully refuted.” The
House of Parliament ordered this tract to be burnt by the common
hangman, and, for its publication, the writer was doomed to
five years’ imprisonment. Biddle was repeatedly imprisoned after
this, and died September 22, 1662.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was a man of great ability, and was an unwearied student.
It is said that he retained the whole of the New Testament in his
memory <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>verbatim</i></span>, not only in English, but in Greek, as far as
the fourth chapter of the Revelation. His persecutions made
converts to his principles, particularly in London; and from these
he formed a distinct and separate society, not only for the purpose
of divine worship, but for the free investigation of theological
questions. The members of this society were called, from
Biddle, <em>Bidellians</em>; and, from their agreement in opinion with
the followers of Socinus, they were denominated Socinians. The
name, however, which most properly characterised their leading
sentiment was that of <em>Unitarians</em>; and in this way the Unitarian
sect in England had its origin.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is a disgraceful fact that the life and works of this archheretic
were in the hands of the pupils of Morton’s academy, and
that Wesley was actually employed to translate some of those pernicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>writings, and was promised a considerable gratuity for
doing it. He says, “When I saw what it was, I proceeded no
farther.” He might, however, have proceeded farther, and, like
many other juvenile aspirants, whilst dabbling in Socinian works,
might have become a Socinian himself; and, instead of becoming
an honoured rector of the Established Church, and the father of
the greatest reformer of the age, and of the best uninspired hymnist
since the days of King David, he might have dwindled down
into a cold-hearted sceptic, with a creed composed of negatives,
and a life bereft of blessings to those among whom he moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no intention, in all this, to censure Mr Morton. Twenty
years after these proceedings, Wesley, in his pamphlet against
Dissenting Academies, does honour both to Mr Morton and himself,
by writing thus: “I must, and ever will, do my tutor the
justice to assert that, whenever the young men had any discourse
of the government, and talked disaffectedly, or disloyally, he never
failed to rebuke and admonish them to the contrary, telling us
expressly, more than once, that it was none of our business to censure
such as God had set over us; that small miscarriages ought
not to be magnified, nor severely reflected on, there never having
been a government so exact or perfect but what had some of those
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>neavi</i></span> in it. He also cautioned us against writing lampoons and
scandalous libels concerning our superiors, and that, not only
because it was dangerous so to do, but likewise immoral.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Considering the disgraceful prosecutions to which Mr Morton
had been subjected, such a testimony shows him to have been a
man of high principle and honour; but Mr Morton, perhaps, was
unable to prevent less honourable ministers having access to the
students of his academy; or of his students having access to them.
Besides, while the bulk of his students were without doubt respectable
and virtuous young men, it is not unfair to imagine that, as
in other seminaries, so in this, there might be bad characters, who
would try to infect the rest. And, in addition to all this, while we
hesitate in accusing young Wesley of strictly immoral conduct, we
are quite prepared to think, that the exuberance of spirit, liveliness
of wit, and adventurous heroism, which seem to be characteristics of
the Wesley family, would often hurry him into improprieties, which
he doubtless lamented in after life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley writes, “that some of the gravest, eldest, and most
learned of Dissenting ministers encouraged and pushed him on in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>his silly lampoons both on Church and State,” that they “gave
him subjects, and furnished him with matter; that they transcribed,
reviewed, and corrected his writings before they were
put to press; and that they taught him to equivocate, by telling
him, that, when he was charged with being the author of such
publications, he might deny that they were his,” because of the
“very weighty and honest reason that there might be <em>some literal</em>
mistakes in the printing.” He also adds, that it was from among
the most famous of the Dissenting ministers that he “learned
this way of writing;” “that it was in their hands he first saw the
lampoons which were then most famous against the Government;
and that he had often heard them repeated by their own lips, oaths
and all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These are weighty charges against the Dissenting ministers of
that period; and we have no means of refuting them. Still, while
the allegations of Samuel Wesley, in the main, are doubtless true,
it is only common charity to infer that these hot-headed, lampooning
ministers were exceptions to the general rule; and it is only
fair, even to them, to remind the reader that the Government and
the age against whom the lampoons were written, were almost as
corrupt and vile as profligate and abandoned wickedness could
make them.</p>

<p class='c001'>After all, it was a perilous thing for a young, sprightly fellow,
like Samuel Wesley, whose father and grandfather had, by the
existing Government, been ejected from their livings, reduced to
beggary, and hunted to a premature grave, and whose mother, in
consequence of such tyranny, was even now pining in some obscure
dwelling, crushed with the sorrows of a too early widowhood, and
compelled to submit to the humiliation of being, to some extent,
dependent upon the charity of her friends; we say, it was a perilous
thing for such a young man to be brought into close connexion
with such political parsons. No wonder that he acknowledges
that, when he came to Mr Morton’s school, “he was forward enough
to write lampoons and pasquils;” “was abundantly zealous in the
cause;” “was fired with hopes of suffering;” “and often wished
to be brought before kings and rulers, because he thought what he
did was done for the sake of Christ.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the ministerial tempters of this high-spirited and
exceedingly clever youth. In Morton’s academy, there were about
fifty pupils, many of whom were doubtless as headstrong as himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and at least two of whom were a great deal worse than this,
being not only headstrong, but lewd and vicious. Would it have
been surprising, if, under such circumstances, Samuel Wesley had
fallen into worse errors than what he did? and is it not owing to
the prayers of his dead father, the training of his widowed mother,
and the restraining grace of God’s good Spirit, that, in after life, he
was able to tell his enemies, face to face, without fear of contradiction,
that, though he was not an “exemplary liver” while at Mr
Morton’s academy, he was not a “scandalous one?” He admits
that he was too keen and revengeful, and that if he thought a person
had injured him, he could not forgive such a person, without
receiving something which he thought to be satisfaction. That
seems to have been one of his greatest crimes; but now all such
revengeful feeling was done away; and it was the greatest pleasure
of his life to forgive and to oblige an enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before quitting the “school days” of Samuel Wesley, perhaps it
may be interesting to add, that, besides himself, several of his
school-fellows rose to great eminence.</p>

<p class='c001'>For instance, there was Timothy Cruso, “the golden preacher,”
as he was called, and who was so great a textuary, says Dunton,
that he could pray two hours together in Scripture language. Also
Obadiah Marriott, who was Dunton’s uncle, and for many years
officiated as minister at Chiswick, and at Croydon.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Shower was another of Morton’s pupils. He was born at
Exeter, and was educated, first in his native city, then at a Dissenting
academy at Taunton, and then at Newington Green; was encouraged,
by Dr Manton, to begin preaching before he was twenty,
and, at twenty-two, was ordained assistant to Vincent Alsop, at
Tothill Fields; established a successful lecture against Popery, in
Exchange Alley; and, some years afterwards, went abroad, and
became lecturer to the English Church at Utrecht and Rotterdam.
In 1690 he became assistant to the great John Howe, in Silver
Street, London, and finally settled down at the new meeting-house,
in Old Jewry, where he continued to preach, with great popularity,
until his death in 1715. He was the author of—1. “Serious Reflections
on Time and Eternity.” 2. “Practical Reflections on the
great Earthquakes in Jamaica and Italy,” &amp;c. 3. “Family Religion.”
4. “The Life of Henry Gearing.” 5. “Funeral and Sacramental
Discourses.” 6. “Winter Meditations,” &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. He was
a great favourite of John Dunton’s, who describes him as “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>popular preacher, with a small shrill voice, and noted for his
funeral sermons.” In his “Dissenting Doctors,” Dunton writes
in extravagant and doggerel rhyme:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Shower—thy name and nature both agree,</div>

      <div class='line'>Have often made our graces spring again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Another of Wesley’s school-fellows was the celebrated Daniel
Defoe—the son of a London butcher, and born the year before
Wesley was—the master of five languages, and a diligent student of
mathematics, natural philosophy, geography, history, and logic; a
man who commenced trade as a horse-dealer; but who paid less attention
to trade than to politics; and hence, at the age of thirty-one,
was bankrupt, and had to compound with his creditors. Trade
failing, Defoe turned author, and published several works, which
gained him the confidence of King William, and excited great attention.
In 1703, he issued his publication entitled, “The Shortest
Way with Dissenters,” of which more anon. In 1704, he commenced
the <cite>Review</cite>, a periodical which extended to nine quarto volumes,
and which pointed the way to the <cite>Tatlers</cite>, <cite>Spectators</cite>, and <cite>Guardians</cite>
that followed. After this, he was, in more instances than
one, employed by the Government, and was granted a Government
pension. By his <cite>Family Instructor</cite>, the family of George I. were
instructed; his “Robinson Crusoe” is too well known to need
description; while his “Captain Singleton,” “Moll Flanders,”
“Religious Courtship,” “Cavalier,” “Colonel Jack,” and “Fortunate
Mistress;” his “Journal of the Plague,” “Political History
of the Devil,” and “New Voyage Round the World,” if not read
now, used to be read by admiring myriads. Defoe was a marvellous
man, and something more will have to be said concerning him.
He died in poverty, four years before Samuel Wesley died, and was
buried in Bunhill Fields, in 1731.</p>

<p class='c001'>Space forbids any further mention of the school-fellows of young
Wesley; and we can only add, that, notwithstanding the dangers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to which he was exposed, and excepting the censurable proceedings
already noticed, he left London with an unblemished character,
and considerably advanced in classical learning, by the instructions
of the two pious and eminent men who acted as his tutors. He
had the opportunity of attending the ministry of Stephen Charnock,
John Bunyan, and many other of the most popular preachers of the
day; and, before he went to Oxford, had taken down many hundreds
of their sermons. Though he left the Dissenters, it would be folly
to deny that these dissenting sermons greatly enriched his mind,
and helped to mould his moral character.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br />UNIVERSITY DAYS—1683—1688.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Samuel Wesley left the Dissenters in 1683. Why? His son, the
Rev. John Wesley, shall answer. His statement is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some severe invectives being written against the Dissenters,
Mr S. Wesley, being a young man of considerable talents, was
pitched upon to answer them. This set him on a course of reading,
which soon produced an effect different from what had been
intended. Instead of writing the wished-for answer, he himself
conceived he saw reason to change his opinions; and actually
formed a resolution to renounce the Dissenters, and attach himself
to the Established Church. He lived at that time with his mother
and an old aunt, both of whom were too strongly attached to the
Dissenting doctrines to have borne, with any patience, the disclosure
of his design. He therefore got up one morning, at a very early
hour, and, without acquainting any one with his purpose, set out
on foot to Oxford, and entered himself of Exeter College.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s own account is, in substance, the following:—While
he was a student in the Dissenting academies in London,
Dr Owen wished him and some others to graduate at the universities,
on the ground that the Dissenters were expecting the times
to change, and that in a little while their party would be looked
upon with greater favour, and their pupils be allowed to take
university degrees. Owen, however, insisted that on no account
whatever ought they to take the oaths and subscriptions.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Wesley was still in doubt whether to adopt Dr Owen’s
advice, he began to study for himself the usual arguments for
separating from the Church. He writes—“I earnestly implored
the divine direction in a business of so weighty a concern, and on
which so much of my whole life depended. I examined things over
and over, as calmly and impassionately as possible; and the farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>I looked, still the more the mist cleared up, and things appeared
in another sort of light than I had seen them in all my life before.
So far were the sufferings of the Dissenters at that time from
influencing my resolution to leave them, that, I profess, it was a
thing which retarded me most of any. The ungenerosity of quitting
them in their meaner fortunes, when I had been a sharer in
their better, I knew not how to get over. Still, I began to have
some inclinations to the University, if I knew how to get thither,
or to live there when I came; but then I was not acquainted with
one soul of the Church of England, or, at least, with none to whom
I might address myself for assistance or advice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was now offered employment among the Dissenters, (having
been with them nearly four years,) either in a gentleman’s house,
or as chaplain to an East Indian ship; but my inclinations were
more for Oxford, where, I thought, I might have opportunities
more fully to study the point which I was now almost resolved
upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Still there were some rubs lay in my way thither, which our
people generally urged to prevent us from such intentions. I was
told (1.) that the Universities were so scandalously debauched that
there was no breathing for a sober man in them; (2.) that the
Church of England, so far from encouraging Dissenters to close
with her communion, generally frowned on those who did so, and
never loved nor trusted them; and (3.) that the nation was so
unanimously against the Church of England, that the bishops and
hierarchy would certainly have a speedy fall; and even rats and
mice were wise enough to quit a tumbling house, and not to run
into it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In reference to the first of these objections, he says—“I resolved
not to believe a word about Oxford debauchery till I saw it, for
which now a very happy opportunity offered. Dr Owen having
died, the trustees of the £10 exhibition<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> requested me to enter the
university with all speed. To this end I went to Oxford, and
stayed there some time. I found many sober and religious men,
as well as some Rakehells; and discoursed several points on which
I still hesitated a little, and received satisfaction on them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He adds, that having been so long with the Dissenters, he still
thought, even after he went to Oxford, that Episcopacy would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>be abolished; and not being willing to be over hasty, he returned
to London to give the subject further consideration. Soon
after his return, he had £20 given him,—part of a considerable
some of money, left by a Dissenter, to be distributed among
ministers. With this he paid his debts, as far as it would go,
and then resolved for Oxford as soon as possible,—whither accordingly
he went, in the name of God, and entered himself there, the
—— day in August 1683, a servitor of Exeter College.</p>

<p class='c001'>When he had been some months at college, and after several
letters had passed between them, he was “followed by a young
gentleman, one of his fellow-pupils at his first tutor’s, who was
now a Fellow of Exeter College, and ordained a priest.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This is all that is known of the reasons that induced Samuel
Wesley to leave the Church of his fathers, except another little
incident mentioned by himself. He writes—“A reverend and
worthy person, my relation, who lived at a great distance, coming
to London, was so kind as to see me while I was at Mr Morton’s,
and gave me such arguments against the Dissenting schism, which
I was then embarked with, as added weight to my resolutions,
when I began to think of leaving it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The above account differs from the accounts which previous
biographers have published; but, being taken from Mr Wesley’s
own writings, there can be no doubt of its correctness.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Samuel Wesley set out for Oxford, all that he possessed
was forty-five shillings. By leaving the Dissenters, he had forfeited
the friendship of all the friends he had. His mother was a
poor forlorn widow, utterly unable to afford him help; and yet,
this well-nigh penniless young man resolves to obtain for himself
a university education and university degrees. He was nearly
five years at college; and yet, five shillings was all the assistance
which, during that period, he received from his family and friends.
To ride to college was a thing not to be thought about. To use
his own expression, he “<em>footed it</em>.” His books, his clothes, and
his other luggage, were all probably carried in a knapsack on his
back. Thus the young student entered Oxford, friendless and
well-nigh moneyless, in 1683; and, five years after, he left it, not
dishonoured, but with B.A. attached to his subsequently distinguished
name,—having managed to support himself, and to pay
his fees, by his own endeavours, and to bring away with him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>purse more than four times heavier than the purse he took. He
started with forty-five shillings: he left with two hundred and
fifteen. How was this accomplished? We shall shortly see.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following description of Exeter College is taken from “A
Pocket Companion for Oxford,” published in the middle of the
eighteenth century:—The front of Exeter College is 220 feet long,
in the centre of which is a magnificent gate, with a tower over it.
The building within chiefly consists of a large quadrangle, formed
by the hall, the chapel, the rector’s lodgings, and the chambers of
the students. The gardens are neatly disposed, and, though within
the town, have an airy and pleasant opening to the east. The
library is well furnished with books in the several arts and sciences,
and with a very valuable collection of the classics, given by Edward
Richards, Esq. It also contains a large orrery, the gift of Thomas
Blackall, Esq. The hall was built by Sir John Ackland, and the
chapel by Dr Hakewell. Hakewell was a man of eminence.
Having been appointed chaplain to Prince Charles, he deemed it
his duty to attempt to convince his royal pupil that he would act
wisely in abandoning his contemplated marriage with the Infanta
of Spain. This so enraged Charles’s father, that he ordered Hakewell
to be arrested and imprisoned. Under the reign of Charles,
however, he was promoted to the bishopric of Worcester, and was
elected Rector of Exeter College. When the civil wars commenced,
he submitted to the authority of Parliament, and retained his office
as rector of the college till his death, in 1649. His chief work is
a folio volume, on the “Power and Providence of God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The founder of Exeter College was Walter Stapleton, Bishop of
Exeter, Lord Treasurer of England, and Secretary of State to King
Edward II., 1316. He founded a society of thirteen—that is, a
rector and twelve fellows—one of whom, the chaplain, was to be
appointed by the dean and chapter of Exeter; eight were to be
elected out of the archdeaconries of Exeter, Totnes, and Barnstaple;
and four out of the archdeaconry of Cornwall. Among the subsequent
benefactors of Exeter College was Edmund Stafford, Bishop
of Exeter, who settled two fellowships for the diocese of Sarum.
Sir William Petre obtained a new charter and new statutes, and
founded eight additional fellowships. Charles I. added one for
Jersey and Guernsey; and Mrs Shiers added two more for Hertford
and Surrey. The number of students was about eighty, and
the visitor was the Bishop of Exeter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Samuel Wesley entered this college as a <em>servitor</em>. A “servitor”
means a scholar or student, who attends and waits on another
scholar or student, and receives, as a compensation, his maintenance.
Such was the position of young Wesley. There was no help for it.
He was determined to secure the benefits of a university education;
and, in the absence of money and of friends, he became a servant
to some other scholar in order to find himself bread. There was
no disgrace in this; and yet, it is not difficult to imagine that
such a “servitor,” notwithstanding his cleverness, would be subjected
to taunts from beardless youths, who, in all respects excepting
one, were vastly his inferiors. Here was a young man, twenty-one
years of age, respectably connected, highly educated, but well-nigh
as poor as poverty could make him, resolved upon the acquisition
of academic fame; and, in the struggle, battling with his innate
pride, and patiently, if not cheerfully, submitting to annoyances
for the sake of obtaining that upon which his heart was set.
Difficulties, which would have discouraged others, aroused him;
and he resolved to conquer or to die.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley was a servitor; and he was also entered as
<em>pauper scholaris</em>, which was the lowest of the four conditions of
members of the Exeter College. He began as low as he could
begin; but struggling with discouragements increased his strength
instead of lessening it. He rose superior to his obstacles. Besides
attending to the humiliating duties of a servitor, he composed
exercises for those who had more money than mind, and gave instructions
to those who wished to profit by his lessons; and thus,
by unwearied toil and great frugality, the poor, fatherless, and
friendless scholar, not only managed to support himself, but when
he retired from Oxford in 1688, he was seven pounds fifteen
shillings richer than he was when he first entered it in 1683. Who
can tell his struggles during the five years of privation spent at
this great seat of learning? His <em>servitorial</em> services might obtain
him bread; but what about the payment of his fees, the purchase
of his clothes, and the procuring of fire? The first winter of his
residence at Oxford, was one of the severest recorded in the annals
of English history. Calamy tells us that “the Thames was frozen
over, and the ice so firm and strong, that there were hundreds of
booths and shops upon it. Coaches plied as freely from the
Temple Stairs to Westminster, as if they had gone upon the land.
All sorts of diversions were practised on the congealed waters, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>even an ox was roasted whole on the river, over against Whitehall.”
Such was the bitter commencement of Samuel Wesley’s collegiate
life; and, at the most, he only had about two pounds, in his almost
needless purse, to meet it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Necessity is the mother of invention.” It was this, probably,
that induced Samuel Wesley to publish his first work in 1685.
Whilst he was at Mr Veal’s and Mr Morton’s academies, he wrote
a number of boyish rhymes, several of which were recited from
the platforms of those academies, and gained applause from the
tutors and pupils present. Other poetical pieces of a similar description
were written after he went to Oxford; and the whole,
during the second year of his residence, were published under the
title of “Maggots; or Poems on several subjects never before
handled, by a Scholar, London. Printed for John Dunton, at the
sign of the Black Raven, near the Royal Exchange, 1685.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This book will neither instruct the reader, nor contribute to the
author’s literary fame; and yet, because it was the first book published
by an eminent literary man; and because it is now so extremely
scarce, that hardly one Wesleyan student in a thousand
has ever seen it, a brief description of it may be interesting, if
not useful.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book begins with an anonymous portrait of the author,
crowned with laurel, and having a Maggot seated on his brow.
Beneath the portrait are the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In his own defence the author writes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because when this foul maggot bites,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>He ne’er can rest in quiet:</div>
      <div class='line'>Which makes him make so sad a face,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’d beg your worship, or your grace,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Unsight, unseen, to buy it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The book consists of 172 pages; and is dedicated “To the
honoured Mr H. D——, Head Master of the Free School in D——,
in the county of D——.” “Mr H. D——” was Mr Henry
Dolling, who was Samuel Wesley’s schoolmaster at Dorchester.
In the dedication, he informs us that this book is his “first
formed birth,” and, in his epistle to the reader, he says that “all
the Maggots are the natural issue of his own brain pan, born and
bred there, and only there.” In reply to the objection, that the
work is “light, vain, frothy, and below the gravity of a man, at
least of a Christian,” he says, if the objector will lend him a handful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of beard, and be at the charge of grafting it on, he will promise
a speedy and thorough reformation. Besides, he argues, that time
ought to be allowed for recreation as well as work; and, moreover,
he hopes that he has written nothing to make even himself
or his reader blush. He was never vain enough to think that his
“Maggots” would procure him much reputation; neither was he
ambitious of seeing his worthy name glittering in a Term Catalogue;
and therefore he thought it not worth his while to throw away
better time in making his book more perfect.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Many of the poems flash with wit, and are most pleasantly expressed.
Sometimes there is a want of delicacy; but that, perhaps,
is not so much the fault of the man, as of the age in which
he wrote. Southey says, “His imagination seems to have been
playful and diffuse; and had he written during his son’s celebrity,
some of his pieces might perhaps have been condemned by the
godly as profane.” Dr A. Clarke demurs to this, and not without
reason. There are in the “Maggots” what the present refined
age would call indelicate and coarse expressions; but, in this
respect, Samuel Wesley was only imitating Dryden and the
standard writers of the period in which he lived.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several of the poems are levelled against the vices of the day,
and are scorchingly severe; but it would scarcely answer any good
purpose to reproduce them.</p>

<p class='c001'>We merely give one extract, taken from the piece on “the
Tobacco Pipe,” and which is a fair specimen of the entire book.
Perhaps, also, it indicates that he had already fallen into the unfortunate
habit of smoking, which will have to be noticed in due
time:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In these raw mornings, when I’m freezing ripe,</div>
      <div class='line'>What can compare with a tobacco pipe?</div>
      <div class='line'>Primed, cock’d, and touch’t, ’twould better heat a man</div>
      <div class='line'>Than ten Bath faggots, or Scotch warming pan.</div>
      <div class='line'>For the toothache ’tis a specific aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>For every amorous boy, or lovesick maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes another way to work ’twill go,</div>

      <div class='line'>This physic is more safe, (though not so fine,)</div>
      <div class='line'>Than bumpers crown’d too oft with sparkling wine.</div>
      <div class='line'>A glass is not a better cure than that,</div>
      <div class='line'>For care, or toothache, both of which would kill a cat.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Surely when Prometheus climb’d above the poles,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slyly to learn their art of making souls,</div>
      <div class='line'>When of his fire he fretting Jove did wipe,</div>
      <div class='line'>He stole it thence in a tobacco pipe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, predisposed to live, as down he ran,</div>
      <div class='line'>By the soul’s plastic power, from clay was turn’d to man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the “Dunciad”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> of Alexander Pope, there is a line which
seems to refer to Samuel Wesley’s “Maggots.” The reference is
not clear and undeniable; but still it has an air of probability. In
his first book, line 53, Pope writes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here she beholds the chaos dark and deep,</div>

      <div class='line'>Figures ill-pair’d, and similes unlike.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This first book of Samuel Wesley’s was published by the
eccentric John Dunton, who was born three years before Wesley,
and therefore was now a young publisher, of not more than
twenty-six years of age. His father was a clergyman, and he was
intended for the same profession; but, being found too volatile,
he was apprenticed to Thomas Parkhurst, the most eminent Presbyterian
bookseller in the three kingdoms. Wesley was acquainted
with Dunton before he went to Oxford. A year previous to his
removal thither, he was present at Dunton’s wedding, and presented
to the happy couple an epithalamium. The object of Dunton’s
choice was Elizabeth, one of the daughters of Dr Samuel Annesley,
and sister of her who six years afterwards became the wife of Wesley.
Dunton commenced business near the Royal Exchange. His
affairs prospered for the first three years, until the stagnation cast
upon trade by the defeat of Monmouth in the west. In the same
year that he published Wesley’s “Maggots,” he sustained some
serious losses, and went to America to repair his fortune. Twelve
months afterwards, he came back to his wife and to her father;
but, on account of his pecuniary embarrassments, he was, for nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a year, a sort of domestic prisoner, and, to avoid arrest, durst not
cross the threshold of the house in which he lived. The only
time, in the course of ten months, that he ventured to go out of
doors, was on a Sunday to hear Dr Annesley, his father-in-law,
preach. To prevent detection, he shaved off his beard, and put
on a woman’s clothes. He got safe to the meeting-house, and sat
down in the obscurest corner he could find. He was returning
home, through Bishopsgate Street, with all the circumspection and
care imaginable, when an unlucky rogue cried out, “I’ll be hanged
if that be not a man in woman’s clothes!” Away Dunton ran as
fast as his legs could carry him; a mob of twenty or thirty persons
ran after him; but his intimate knowledge of the alleys in
that part of the city, enabled him to dodge and get rid of his
pursuers, and, in great trepidation he reached his house without
arrest.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Dunton became wearied with this confinement, and made
a trip to Holland, Flanders, and Germany, and returned to London
in 1688. On the same day that the Prince of Orange entered
the capital, Dunton re-opened his place of business. Here he
printed six hundred books, and says, there were only seven of them
which occasioned him repentance. In 1692 he became possessed
of a considerable estate, by the decease of a cousin, and was elected
a member of the Company of Stationers. At the age of thirty-eight
he was bereaved of his first wife, whose decease he bitterly
lamented; but, before the year was out, consoled himself by
another marriage with Sarah, daughter of Mrs Nicholas of St
Albans. This lady added neither to his comfort nor his fortune.
He left her soon after they were married, and became financially
embarrassed to the end of life. He died in obscurity two years
before Samuel Wesley, in 1733, aged seventy-four.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dunton was a strange mortal; a man half mad, and yet possessed
of genius, and a dabbler in all sorts of books. In 1710 he
produced his “Athenianism; or, New Projects,” in which he
actually announced his intention to publish six hundred distinct
treatises, all written by himself. He was far too wild and
whimsical to be prosperous.</p>

<p class='c001'>His description of himself is amusingly characteristic. He
says, he was of middle stature; his hair black and curled; his eyes
quick and full of spirit; his lips red and soft; his face, though
not so beautiful as some, yet rendered amiable by a cheerful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>sprightly air; his body slender and well proportioned; and his
spirit pious and devout. He was plentiful in wit; his way of
writing excellent; he had great skill in poetry; his temper was
sweet; and he was the most passionate and constant lover living.
His friendship was courted by all who knew him. He was hard
to be displeased; and, when offended, was easy to be reconciled.
His soul was tender and compassionate; and his modesty more
than usually great.</p>

<p class='c001'>In completing this modest portraiture of himself, Dunton adds,
“To finish this imperfect description, I must sincerely say, I have
all those good qualities that are necessary to render me an accomplished
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was John Dunton, the publisher of Samuel Wesley’s first
literary production. Dunton says, “The rector of Epworth got
his bread by the ‘Maggots;’” but Dunton, when he wrote that,
had imbibed an implacable hatred towards Wesley, and what he
says must be received with caution. No doubt the college
finances of young Wesley were extremely low, and, perhaps, in
publishing his “Maggots,” he had some hope of raising them;
but it is scarce likely that the poor scholar would gain much by
his adventure, inasmuch as, from the size of his book, the publishing
price did not probably exceed a shilling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s time at the university was well occupied.
First of all, he had to attend to his duties as servitor, for on that,
to some extent, his maintenance depended. Then, to obtain
money for the payment of his fees, he gave assistance to other
students not so far advanced, nor so willing to submit to hard
work as he was. Then he had to prepare for his own examinations,
on the result of which depended his obtaining a university
degree; and this he did so successfully, that on the 19th of June
1688, he was created Bachelor of Arts; the only student of Exeter
College that, during that year, obtained such a distinction.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such labours were onerous; but, whilst his time must have
been greatly occupied with his daily duties, his benevolent heart
would not permit him to live wholly to himself. He was not
only ambitious to raise himself, but he likewise yearned to benefit
others; and, it is a remarkable coincidence, that the objects of
his sympathy were exactly of the same class as those who, forty-five
years afterwards, were visited and helped by his sons, John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and Charles, and the other Oxford Methodists. Notwithstanding
the weightiness of his college work, and the lightness of his college
purse, he found time to visit the poor wretched inmates of Oxford
Gaol, and gladly relieved them as far as he was able. Writing to
his two sons, in 1730, when they had begun, of their own accord,
to visit the same prison house, he says:—“Go on, in God’s name,
in the path to which your Saviour has directed you, and that
track wherein your father has gone before you! For when I was
an undergraduate at Oxford I visited those in the castle there, and
reflect on it with great satisfaction to this day. Walk as prudently
as you can, though not fearfully, and my heart and prayers
are with you.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When Samuel Wesley had spent about eighteen months at the
university King Charles II. died, and James II. succeeded him.
A few months afterwards, Oxford was honoured with a visit from
this papistical monarch, and an event happened which exercised
an important influence on Wesley’s subsequent career. One of
the historians of Methodism has said, it is a remarkable fact that,
though Samuel Wesley had “the piety and persecutions of his
father and grandfather in his memory, and though the condition
and tendencies of the court were open to his inspection, he was
very much attached to the interests of King James.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This statement rests entirely on the testimony of Dr A. Clarke,
who says, “His son John has been heard to state that at first his
father was very much attached to the interests of James.” It is
deferentially submitted whether this is strictly true. It is scarce
likely that a young man of intelligence, scholarship, and honour,
like Samuel Wesley; a young man whose father and grandfather
had been ejected from their churches, and hunted to their graves
by the myrmidons of Stuart perfidy; and a young man, whose
entire life had been spent in the society and schools of those who
hated, and had just cause to hate, the Stuart dynasty; we say it is
scarce likely that such a young man would feel either much attachment,
or any attachment at all, to a despotic and royal traitor like
the one just mentioned. But, be that as it may, the occurrence
which happened at Oxford, and which is about to be related, exercised
an important influence on Samuel Wesley’s subsequent behaviour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Almost immediately after James’s accession, in 1685, he obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the appointment of one Massey, a Papist, as Dean of Christ
Church, Oxford. He likewise secured for Obadiah Walker, master
of University College, a concealed Papist, a licence for publishing
popish books,—a licence of which Walker had the courage to
avail himself, for he immediately established in his college both a
printing press and a popish chapel. All this naturally created
great excitement. Soon after, in January 1687, the noble family
of Petre (of whom Father Edward Petre was one) claimed the
right of nomination to seven fellowships in Exeter College, in
which Samuel Wesley was a student. It was acknowledged on
the part of the college that Sir William Petre, who had founded
the fellowships, in the reign of Elizabeth, and likewise his son,
had both exercised the power of nomination, though the latter, as
they contended, had nominated only by sufferance. The Bishop
of Exeter, the visitor of the college, had, in the reign of James I.,
pronounced an opinion against the founder’s descendants, and a
judgment had been obtained against them in the Court of Common
Pleas. Under the sanction of these authorities, the college had,
for seventy years, nominated to these fellowships without disturbance
from the family of Petre. Alibone, the popish lawyer, contended
that this long usage, which would otherwise have been
conclusive, deserved little consideration in a period of such iniquity
towards Catholics, who had been deterred from asserting
their civil rights. King James took up the matter, and demanded
from the university that they should acknowledge a right in
Father Petre to name seven fellows of Exeter College. This the
university most firmly resisted, and the question was referred to
the Courts of Westminster. All this added fuel to the fire already
kindled.</p>

<p class='c001'>But James’s illegal and arbitrary conduct proceeded still further.
He commanded the Fellows of Magdalen College to elect,
as their Master, one Antony Farmer, another concealed Papist.
The Fellows petitioned his Majesty, but finding him not to be
moved, they exercised their own undoubted right, and elected
Dr Howe. A new mandate was issued to the college to elect
Parker, Bishop of Oxford. This man had been a zealous Puritan
preacher under the Commonwealth, a bigoted High Churchman at
the Restoration, and was now a papistical prelate, through his
popish servility to James II. He died a few months after, as
destitute of virtue as of judgment—a drunkard and a miser—unlamented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and even despised by all good men. The Fellows of
Magdalen College refused to accept of James’s nominee, and,
with commendable spirit, stuck to the Master of their own choosing.
James was inexpressibly annoyed; and, in the course of the
summer of 1687, arrived at Oxford. The unmanageable Fellows
of Magdalen were summoned into the royal presence, and were
chid for their disobedience. Samuel Wesley was present, and was
an intensely interested spectator of the disreputable scene. “You
have not dealt with me like gentlemen!” cried the weakly, arrogant,
and furious king; “you have been unmannerly as well as
undutiful. Is this your Church of England loyalty? I could not
have believed that so many clergymen of the Church of England
would have been concerned in such a business. Go home!—get
you gone! I am king! I will be obeyed! Go to your chapel
this instant, and admit the Bishop of Oxford. Let those who
refuse look to it; they shall feel the whole weight of my hand;
they shall know what it is to incur the displeasure of their
sovereign!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here was a call for passive obedience from the very lips of the
Lord’s anointed, but still the Fellows were uncowed; and answering
the royal tyrant respectfully but firmly, they insisted on their
right. They were then privately warned that they would be proceeded
against by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quo warranto</i></span>, and inevitably <a id='corr89.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='loose'>lose</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_89.22'><ins class='correction' title='loose'>lose</ins></a></span> everything.
But still the gownsmen were firm. The king was astonished and
enraged, and issued a commission to examine the state of the
college, with full power to alter the statutes and frame new ones.
The chief of this Commission was Cartwright, Bishop of Chester,
who, like Parker, had been a Puritan in the days of Cromwell,
then a flaming Churchman under Charles, and was now a drunken
tool in the hands of James. The Commissioners arrived at Oxford
on the 20th of October 1687; but Master Howe maintained
his rights, and the rights of the body which had elected him. On
the second day, the Commissioners deprived him of his Mastership,
struck his name from the books, and bound him in a penalty of
£1000 to appear in the King’s Bench. Parker was put into possession
by force, and a majority of the Fellows were at length
prevailed upon to submit to royal dictation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This ought to have satisfied the imperious monarch; but it was
not enough, and he now insisted that the Fellows should acknowledge
their disobedience and repentance in a written submission;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>but right nobly they resisted this stretch of tyranny, withdrew
their former submission, and declared in writing that they could
not acknowledge they had done aught amiss. This led to further
outrages; and, on the 16th of November, judgment was pronounced
against them in the shape of a general deprivation and
expulsion. But even this was not sufficient to appease James’s
vengeance; and hence, a month afterwards, another sentence was
issued, incapacitating all and every of the Fellows of Magdalen
from holding any benefice or preferment in the Church. James
also declared that he would look upon any favour shown to the
Fellows as a combination against himself. They were accordingly
expelled; their places in the university were filled by
avowed Papists, or by very doubtful Protestants; and they themselves
were left to find employment and a maintenance in the
best way they could. James intended to hinder even their friends
offering them assistance; but, notwithstanding his contemptible
threats, considerable collections were made for them; and his own
daughter, the Princess of Orange, sent over £200 for their relief;
so that, in the end, though they obtained the honours of martyrdom,
they experienced little of its sufferings. Twelve months
after their expulsion their intolerant oppressor made a miserable
flight to France, and the Prince of Orange stepped into his
place.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was in the midst of such disreputable proceedings that
Samuel Wesley finished his collegiate training, and left the excited
seat of learning where he had spent the last five years. As already
stated, he was present when James lectured the Fellows of Magdalen
College in such unkingly fashion; and Dr Clarke relates,
on the authority of the Rev. Thomas Stedman, that the spirit of
young Wesley rose in rebellion against this exhibition of royal
arrogance, and that he afterwards remarked: “When I heard him
say to the Master and Fellows of Magdalen College, lifting up his
lean arm, ‘If you refuse to obey me, you shall feel the weight of
a king’s right hand,’ I saw he was a tyrant. And though I was
not inclined to take an active part against him, I was resolved
from that time to give him no kind of support.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This may be true, and yet there is considerable difficulty in
reconciling it with another fact which must be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was during the summer of 1687 that King James played the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>tyrant in Magdalen College, and it was on the 10th of June 1688
that the Prince of Wales was born. The words of young Wesley,
as cited by Dr Clarke, are evidence that he had formed the purpose
to take no part with those who were intent upon the dethronement
of James. He was a man far too loyal to become a
rebel; and yet it cannot be denied that he regarded the interests
of James with indifference. “I was resolved,” says he, “from
that time to give him no support.” While James was king he
would obey him; but while bowing to the royal will, he would
do nothing to maintain and to establish the royal cause. Such
was Wesley’s position in the summer of 1687—one of neutrality,
or, at the most, of mere obedience.</p>

<p class='c001'>But twelve months afterwards, at the birth of the Prince of
Wales, a change seems to have come over him. The nation took
but little interest in this event; in fact, it, was alleged that the
birth of a royal prince was a royal imposition; and though the
court commanded London to make bonfires, and to exhibit other
signs of rejoicing, London was sullen, and would provide no rejoicings,
except for the seven bishops which were then imprisoned
in the Tower, but for whose rescue from the royal tyranny of
James the country was most earnestly hoping. Among other
means which were used to extort congratulations respecting the
royal birth, was a more than mere gentle hint to the University
of Oxford that it would be expected to furnish a volume of congratulatory
poems, and that even Magdalen College itself would
join in this.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Strange to say, the hint was adopted, and a book
was written containing more than a hundred poetic pieces professing
joy at the birth of a Prince of Wales.</p>

<p class='c001'>That volume is now before us. Its title-page bears the following
inscription:—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Strenæ Natalitiæ Academiæ Oxoniensis, in
Clarissimum Principem: Oxonii E Theatro Sheldoniano. An.
Dom. 1668.”</span> It consists of 86 folio pages, each of which is
headed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In Natalem Sereniss. Principis Walliæ.”</span> About ninety
of the poems are in Latin, two are in Greek, four in Arabic, one
in Hebrew, and twelve in English. The celebrated Hebrew professor,
Dr Edward Pococke, wrote his in Arabic. Samuel Wesley
and eleven others wrote theirs in English. Most of the colleges,
Magdalen included, are represented. The writers belonging to
Exeter College are, Sir Henry Northcote, Bart., John Read, Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Maundrell, and Samuel Wesley. Wesley’s poem is the last but
two in the book, and fills two pages. The poem is too long for
insertion here, but the reader will find it complete, with the
exception of about half a dozen small errors, in Dr Clarke’s
“Wesley Family.” Suffice it to say, that Wesley represents
Ariosto as bringing his lyre from heaven to join in the rejoicings.
Ariosto also draws “a vocal picture” of the royal group. The
“dazzling lustre” of all the graces shines around the eyes of the
happy Queen; “Great James’s” joy is “too bright to be expressed,”
and therefore the poet puts “a modest veil around his
radiant head;” while the infant prince has his mother’s eyes,
through which, however, shines his father’s soul. The child is “a
child of miracles,” and a “son of prayers;” he is to defend “his
father’s mighty throne,” and to give “Europe peace;” he is to
have “valiant brothers,” who will “share in his triumphs;” and
when he visits Oxford, the “venerable men, who met Great James
his father, will also crowd around him.” As the result of his
reign, there will be no “cloudy foreheads,” and “no contracted
brows;”—in fact, a “new world” will “begin,” and a “golden
age” commence.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the substance of Samuel Wesley’s poem. The young
prince is most lavishly extolled; but the only praise bestowed on
the father is that he was “<em>great</em>,” and perhaps “brave” and loving.
At first sight, the poem seems to clash with the statement
that Samuel Wesley had resolved, twelve months before, to yield
to James nothing more than mere obedience; but, in reality,
there is no such collision. Wesley had no sympathy with James’s
tyrannical proceedings; but, at the same time, he could not deny,
what most historians acknowledge, that James was a knave rather
than a fool. If James’s reign was still continued, he would take
no part against him; and if James was succeeded by his infant
son, he augurs and hopes that he will be able to give brightness
to foreheads at present “cloudy,” and to smooth the brows which
are now contracted; in short, that he will be able to defend the
throne of his father, and to give peace to Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have felt it necessary to go at greater length than we
wished into this part of Samuel Wesley’s history, because of the
importance which has been attached to it by a most able article
on “The Ancestry of the Wesleys,” in the <cite>London Quarterly
Review</cite> for April 1864. Our conviction is, that Samuel Wesley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>was an intensely loyal man; and that, notwithstanding all the
outrageous tyranny of King James, he would never have taken
part against him; but when James <a id='corr93.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ignominously'>ignominiously</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_93.3'><ins class='correction' title='ignominously'>ignominiously</ins></a></span> fled, and William
and Mary, by the voice of the nation, were proclaimed his
successors, Wesley felt that he owed to them the loyalty and
obedience that he had paid to James; and, to use his own words,
as a proof of his loyalty, he wrote, in answer to an out-of-door
speech, the first defence of the government that appeared after
William and Mary’s accession; and afterwards published many
other pieces, both in prose and verse, having the same end in
view.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br />NATIONAL AFFAIRS—1685–1688.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A quarter of a century was the time that Charles II. occupied the
throne of Great Britain. His reign was a continued scene of royal
perfidy and sensual dissipation. He was a deceiver, a despot, and
a defiler. He was the slave of women, and his court was the school
of vice. For five-and-twenty years he played the hypocrite, by
professing himself an orthodox Protestant, when, all the while,
he was, in fact, an infidel. In all the relations of life, public and
private, he was unprincipled, profligate, false, vicious, and corrupt;
whilst, from the example of his debauched and licentious court,
public morals contracted a taint which it required little less than
a century to obliterate, and which for a time wholly paralysed the
character of the nation.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> He had good talents, and in society
was kind, familiar, communicative; but he was indolent, negligent
of the interests of the nation, careless of its glory, averse to
its religion, jealous of its liberty, lavish of its treasure, and sparing
only of its blood. It has been remarked of him, and with some
amount of reason, that he never said a foolish thing, nor ever did
a wise one. He had enormous vices, without the tincture of any
virtue to correct them. He died in 1685, begging forgiveness of
his neglected queen, blessing his bastard children, asking for
kindness to be shown to his mistresses, and receiving from a
popish priest the Romish communion, extreme unction, and a
popish pardon.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Duke of York succeeded his brother Charles II. to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>throne, under the title of James II., in the spring of 1685. On
the very first Sunday after his accession he went to mass with all
the ensigns of royalty. While he was a subject, James was in
the habit of hearing mass, with closed doors, in a small oratory
which had been fitted up for his popish wife; but now that he
was king, he ordered the doors to be thrown wide open, so that
all who came to pay him homage might see the superstitious ceremonial.
Soon, also, a new pulpit was erected in the palace, and,
during Lent, sermons were preached there by popish divines, to the
great disgust of zealous Protestants.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the first acts of James was to throw open the prisons of
England, and to set at liberty thousands of Dissenters and Papists,
who had been enduring a horrible captivity for conscience’ sake.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two months after James’s coronation, the Earl of Argyle and
the Duke of Monmouth, by previous concert, invaded Scotland
and England with a small force from Holland; the former to re-establish
the Covenant, and the latter to secure the Protestant
religion, and to deliver the country from the tyranny of its enthroned
monarch. Argyle sent the fiery cross from hill to hill in
Scotland, and from clan to clan, until he got 2500 Highlanders to
join him. In a few days he was betrayed by his guides, and
was made a prisoner. His hands were tied behind him, and, with
his head bare, and the headsman marching before him, he was
carried to his old cell in Edinburgh Castle, and, on June 30,
was beheaded. Monmouth, in England, met with a much more
general welcome than Argyle found in Scotland. All classes of
the people welcomed him as a deliverer sent from heaven. The
poor rent the air with their joyful acclamations, and the rich
opened their houses and supplied his army with meat and drink.
His path was strewn with flowers; and windows, as he passed
through towns, were crowded with ladies waving their handkerchiefs.
On the 20th of June, at Taunton, he took the title of
king; but, after marching through several parts of the West of
England, his army was scattered, and he was ignominiously captured
in a ditch, disguised as a peasant, with a few peas in his
pocket, and himself half buried among ferns and nettles. With
almost abject meanness, he implored pardon at the hands of James
his uncle, but without effect, for, fifteen days after Argyle was
beheaded in Edinburgh, Monmouth was decapitated on Tower
Hill.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Immediately after Monmouth’s death, Judge Jeffreys was sent
to hold his “bloody assizes” in the west. His first victim was
Mrs Lisle, widow of one of the Commonwealth judges. The
charge against her was that of giving shelter to two of Monmouth’s
fugitives. For this, Jeffreys sentenced her to be burnt alive, and
further ordered that the sentence should be executed on the very
day that his foul mouth uttered it. The clergy of Winchester
promptly interfered; three days’ respite were wrung from the
hard-hearted judge; and the venerable matron was beheaded instead
of being burnt. From Winchester this brutal being went
to Dorchester, on the same murderous business. Here the court,
by order of Jeffreys, was hung with scarlet; more than three
hundred persons were waiting to be tried; two hundred and
ninety-two received sentence of death, but only about eighty were
hanged, the rest being imprisoned, severely whipped, or transported.
Those that were transported were sold as slaves; and
the bodies of those that were hanged were cut into quarters, and
stuck up on gibbets. For this bloody work, and while he was
yet at Dorchester, Jeffreys was rewarded and encouraged by his
applauding and grateful sovereign, who raised him from the seat
of Lord Chief-Justice to that of Lord Chancellor. Jeffreys,
blushing with his new honours, now went from Dorchester to
Exeter, where another red list of two hundred and forty-three
prisoners was laid before him, most of whom in a few days were
hanged, drawn, and quartered. At Taunton, nearly eleven hundred
prisoners were arraigned for high treason. Ten hundred
and forty confessed themselves guilty; only six ventured to put
themselves on trial; and two hundred and thirty-nine, at the
very least, were executed with astounding rapidity. To spread
the terror more widely, these executions took place in not fewer
than thirty-six different towns and villages. The dripping heads
and gory limbs of the deceased were fixed in the most conspicuous
places,—in the streets, by the highways, over town halls, and over
the very churches. At every spot where two roads met, in every
market-place, and on the green of every village that had furnished
Monmouth with men, ironed corpses clattered in the wind, or
heads and quarters of human beings, stuck on poles, poisoned the
air, and made the passing traveller sick with horror. The country,
for a stretch of sixty miles, from Bristol to Exeter, was
studded with a new and terrible sort of sign-posts, adorned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the mangled bodies of its slaughtered inhabitants. The wretched
Jeffreys boasted, when he returned to London, that in his “bloody
campaign” he had hanged more men than all the judges of England
had hanged since the time of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p class='c001'>All these murderous proceedings of Judge Jeffreys had the
approbation of King James, and he continued to be one of the
king’s principal advisers in all the oppressions and arbitrary measures
of his despotic reign. Four years after his legalised massacres
in the West of England, Jeffreys wished to steal away to a
foreign country, there to hide himself and his ill-gotten wealth
from the detestation of mankind; but before he could fulfil his
purpose, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower. The
rabble gathered before his deserted mansion, and read on the
door, with shouts of laughter, the bills which announced the sale
of his property. Even delicate women, who had tears for highwaymen
and housebreakers, breathed nothing but vengeance
against him. The street poets portioned out all his joints with
cannibal ferocity, and computed how many pounds of steaks might
be cut from his well-fattened carcase. He was exhorted to hang
himself with his garters, and to cut his throat with his razor.
His spirit, as mean in adversity as it had been insolent and inhuman
in prosperity, sunk under the load of public abhorrence.
His constitution, originally bad and much impaired by drunkenness,
was completely broken by distress and by anxiety. He was
tortured by a cruel internal disease, which baffled the doctors’
skill. One—only one solace was left to him—brandy. Disease,
assisted by strong drink and by misery, did its work with great
rapidity. The poor wretch dwindled, in a few weeks, from a
portly and even corpulent man to a skeleton; and on the 10th of
April 1689, he died at the early age of forty-one.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But to return. It is a striking coincidence, that about the time
when Judge Jeffreys was holding his “bloody assizes” in the West
of England, King Louis of France was revoking the tolerant
edict of Nantes, and driving thousands of his Huguenot subjects to
England and other lands of exile. Other curious and important
events happened in James’s short reign, which our space permits
to be only mentioned. For instance, Dryden, the greatest writer of
the day, turned Catholic, perhaps to please the royal Papist sitting on
the throne; but Jeffreys refused to do so, on the ground that, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>he was in Africa, he promised the Emperor of Morocco that, if he
ever changed his religion, he would become a Turk. Another
pro-papistical act was this,—King James, asserting a repealing
power over all laws and Acts of Parliament, took upon himself not
only to dismiss Protestants from the highest civil and military
offices, but to put Papists into their places. He likewise gave the
revenues of the Church in Ireland, to a great extent, to popish
bishops and priests, and not merely permitted, but commanded
them to wear their canonicals in public. He cashiered four thousand
Protestant soldiers, stripped them of their uniforms, and left
them to wander hungry and half-naked through the land; their
officers, for the most part, retiring into Holland, and rallying
round the Prince of Orange there.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this excited anxiety, and, at length, the pulpits, even of
High Churchmen, and despite the dogma of passive obedience,
began to resound with warnings and denunciations. James now
suspended Compton, Bishop of London; attempted to convert his
daughter, the Princess Anne, to the popish religion; and tried to
deprive his daughter Mary, the Princess of Orange, of her right to
the succession. He endeavoured to obtain the control of the
public seminaries, schools, and colleges; and to appoint Papists
to be their officers. Four popish bishops were publicly consecrated
in the Chapel Royal,—were sent to their dioceses with
the titles of vicars apostolical; their pastoral letters being also
licensed, printed, and dispersed throughout the kingdom. James
likewise issued letters mandatory to the bishops of England, prohibiting
the clergy to preach upon points of controversy, and
establishing an ecclesiastical commission with more power than had
been possessed by the abominable court over which Laud presided.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the beginning of 1687, a declaration of indulgence was issued
by proclamation at Edinburgh, “We, by our <em>sovereign authority,
prerogative royal, and absolute power</em>, do hereby give and
grant our royal toleration. We allow and tolerate the moderate
Presbyterians to meet in their private houses, and to hear such
ministers as have been, or are willing to accept of our indulgence,
but they are not to build meeting-houses, but to exercise in
houses. We tolerate Quakers to meet in their form in any place,
or places, appointed for their worship: and we, by our sovereign
authority, suspend, stop, and disable, all laws or Acts of Parliament
made or executed against any of our Roman Catholic subjects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>so that they shall be free to exercise their religion and to
enjoy all; but they are to exercise in houses or chapels: and we
cass, annul, and discharge all oaths by which our subjects are
disabled from holding offices.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the 4th of April, 1687, “a declaration for liberty of conscience,”
came out in the <cite>Gazette</cite>, by which all the penal laws
against Protestant Nonconformists, as well as Catholics, were to
be suspended. The declaration gave leave to all men to meet and
serve God after their own manner, publicly as well as privately;
it denounced the royal displeasure, and the vengeance of the laws
against all who should disturb any religious worship; and it
granted a free pardon to all the king’s loving subjects from penalties,
forfeitures, and disabilities incurred on account of religion
and the penal laws.</p>

<p class='c001'>About the same time, King James went to Oxford, and, in the
exercise of his popish inclinations and despotic principles, made
the disgraceful exhibition of himself, in Magdalen College,
which was witnessed by Samuel Wesley, and which is related in
Chapter IV.</p>

<p class='c001'>Twelve months after, on April 27, 1688, he published another
declaration of indulgence, in substance the same as the two above
mentioned; but which went a step farther, for not only was the
declaration published, but all the clergy were commanded to read
it in their churches. This was the spark that set fire to the train,
which had been accumulating for many months.</p>

<p class='c001'>National patience was exhausted. These indulgences were right
enough in principle; but there were two great objections to their
being published. First, it was a most unconstitutional and outrageous
stretch of royal authority to pretend, “by virtue of our
<em>sovereign authority, prerogative royal, and absolute power</em>,” to
“<em>suspend, stop</em>, and <em>disable</em> laws and Acts of Parliament,” without
parliamentary consent. And, secondly, it was well known
that, in publishing these unconstitutional declarations, James was
not actuated with the least wish to do justice to Protestant Nonconformists;
but chiefly, if not exclusively, desired the toleration
of his own sect, the Papists; and hoped that this might be a preparatory
step to the triumphant establishment of the Popish
Church. James’s conduct in Scotland, where he had hacked to
pieces so many Protestants, could not be forgotten, but spoke far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>more loudly than the hollow-hearted language of his indulgent
declarations; besides, the loud denunciations of James’s Lord
Chancellor, the bloodthirsty Jeffreys, against all Protestant Dissenters
as king-haters, rebels, and republicans, were still ringing
in the nation’s ears. The people remembered that, within the last
three years, the great and good Richard Baxter, had been committed
to the King’s Bench Prison on the charge of printing his
paraphrase of the New Testament; and had been brought to trial,
before Jeffreys, at Westminster, at the very time that Titus Oates
was standing in the pillory in the New Palace Yard; Jeffreys
gleefully exclaiming at the moment, “If Baxter stood on the
other side of Oates’s pillory, I would say two of the greatest
rogues and rascals in the kingdom stood there.” The people remembered
that the insulted Baxter, for his alleged offence, had
been fined five hundred marks, and had been ordered to lie in
prison until the fine was paid; besides being bound to good behaviour
for seven years. They were not able to forget, that, in
the very year before the first declaration was issued, the Protestant
Dissenters had again and again had their private religious
meetings, which they had dared to hold, disturbed and broken up,
both in town and country, by the myrmidons of King James’s
government; and that Sir John Hartop, and some others, at
Stoke Newington, had had distresses levied for the payment of a
fine of about £700.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> For James to pretend friendship to Protestant
Dissenters, in the face of such facts, was a piece of
hypocrisy, which none but a royal simpleton, afflicted with a little
mind, and blinded by prejudice, would have attempted to impose
upon the credulity of intelligent and religious men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Never, not even under the tyranny of Laud, had the condition
of the Dissenters been so deplorable as it was under James. Never
had spies been so actively employed in detecting congregations;
and never had magistrates, grand-jurors, rectors, and churchwardens
been so much on the alert. It was impossible for the
sectaries to pray together without precautions such as are employed
by coiners and receivers of stolen goods. Places of worship
had to be frequently changed. Worship had to be performed,
sometimes just before the break of day, and sometimes at dead of
night. Round the building where the little flock was gathered
together, sentinels were placed to give the alarm if a stranger drew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>near. The minister, in disguise, was introduced through the
garden and the back yard. In some houses, there were trap doors,
through which, in case of danger, he might descend. No psalm
was sung; and many contrivances were used to prevent the voice
of the preacher, in his moments of fervour, from being heard outside.
And yet, with all this care, several opulent gentlemen in
the suburbs of London were accused of holding conventicles, and
distresses were levied to the amount of many thousand pounds.
Dissenting ministers, however blameless in life, however eminent
for learning and abilities, could not venture to walk the streets for
fear of outrages, encouraged by those whose duty it was to preserve
the peace. Some divines of great fame were in prison;
others, crushed with oppression, had quitted the kingdom; and
great numbers, who had been accustomed to frequent conventicles,
repaired to the parish church.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>What was the result? James commanded that the declaration,
published on the 27th of April 1688, should be read by all the
clergy in their churches, in and about London, on the 20th and
27th of May; and in all the rest of England and Wales on the
3d and 10th of June following. The bishops<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> were commanded
to be vigilant in enforcing the royal order, and those who refused
to read were to be prosecuted by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.
The 20th of May arrived; but only seven, out of a hundred clergymen
in London read the declaration, and even they read with
fear and trembling, being groaned at by their congregations. On
the 27th of May the signs of obedience were not more numerous;
and a newly-appointed reader at the Chapel Royal was so much agitated
that he was not able to read the declaration so as to be heard.
On the 3d and 10th of June, the mass of the clergy in the provinces
and in Wales, were quite as disobedient as those in the
capital. It is said that, at the time, there were more than ten
thousand clergy in the kingdom, and yet not more than two hundred
complied with the royal will.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here we must pause, for the purpose of spoiling a very
interesting story respecting Samuel Wesley. The Rev. Henry
Moore relates that Samuel Wesley was strongly solicited by the
friends of King James II. to support the measures of the court in
favour of Popery, with a promise of preferment, if he would
comply with the king’s desire. But when the time came for reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the king’s declaration, he most firmly refused; and though
surrounded by courtiers, soldiers, and informers, he preached a
bold and pointed discourse against it from Daniel iii. 17, 18:
“If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand,
O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will
not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou
hast set up.” Unfortunately this heroic story is untrue. As we
shall see shortly, Samuel Wesley was not ordained a deacon until
two months after the declaration was commanded to be read, and
therefore, at the time, was not authorised to preach, either from
such a text, or from any text at all; nor was he in a position
either to read or to refuse to read the king’s declaration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The story has been repeated by Southey, by Macaulay, by Dr
Smith, by Dr Stevens, and by many other of the leading historians
of the age; but, as just shown, it is utterly without foundation.
Henry Moore’s mistake was a simple and easy one. He attributes
to Samuel Wesley a fact which belongs to the Rev. John Berry,
A.M., vicar of Watton, in Norfolk, the father-in-law of Samuel
Wesley, jun. The latter, in a “poem upon a clergyman lately
deceased,” published in 1731, delineates the character of Mr
Berry; and the poem, in substance, contains the story, which
has so long and so often been improperly applied to Samuel
Wesley, sen.:—</p>

<p class='c016'>We are not sure that even this was intended to be considered
as the description of a fact actually occurring in the history of
the poet’s father-in-law. It might be nothing more than a poetical
and general description of the position taken by the ten thousand
clergy, who refused to read King James’s declaration. Anyhow,
for the reason already mentioned, it could not be true of
Samuel Wesley, sen. No doubt Samuel Wesley was as brave a
man as ever lived; and had he been placed in the circumstances,
stated by Henry Moore, he would have had sufficient courage to
act as it is alleged he did. He regarded King James as a tyrant;
and his views of the king’s declaration may be fairly gathered
from the following question and answer in the <cite>Athenian
Oracle</cite>:—<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>Ques.</i> What think you of the liberty of conscience granted in
the late reign? Was it procured by the Catholics out of any
design, or purely for the good and peace of the subjects?</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>Ans.</i> It is contrary to reason to believe that any true and
zealous Papist can be for liberty of conscience, it being a fundamental
of their religion, that all who differ from them in matters
of faith are heretics, and ought to be destroyed. And, as it is natural
for every persuasion to plead for liberty when they are denied it,
and cannot have the freedom to serve God in their own method,
so likewise, experience teaches us, that if the wheel turns, these
very men which abhorred persecution, are no sooner in power but
immediately endeavour by force to bring others to a compliance
with what they profess. And if we find this error amongst the
mildest and most charitable persuasions, we dare confidently
affirm it would not have been otherwise with Roman Catholics,
since they look upon the converting of heretics to be no small
meritorious work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But leaving the ten thousand clergymen who refused to read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>King James’s declaration, and also abstaining from any further
notice of the apochryphal story concerning Samuel Wesley’s
bravery, we must now return to the declaration itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>James commanded this royal manifesto to be read in churches,
and charged the bishops to take care that his mandate was obeyed.
Two days before the time when the declaration was to be first
read, six of the bishops met the primate, Sancroft, at his palace
at Lambeth; and there, with the assent of the ex-minister Lord
Clarendon, and of Tillotson, Stillingfleet, Patrick, Tennison,
Grove, and Sherlock, esteemed the best preachers and writers in
the Church, it was privately resolved that a petition, prepared by
Sancroft, should be forthwith presented to his Majesty. The
petition, which was delivered on the evening of the same day,
humbly showed that the objection of the clergy to read the declaration
did not arise from their want of obedience to the king,
nor yet from any want of tenderness to Dissenters; but because
the declaration was founded upon a dispensing power in the king,
which had often been declared illegal in parliament. James read
the petition, and coolly folded it up, and then, with disdain and
anger, said, “This is a great surprise to me. This is a standard
of rebellion.” The bishops protested against such an interpretation.
James kept muttering, “Is this what I have deserved from
the Church of England? I will remember you who have signed
this paper. I will be obeyed.” On the morrow, as he was on
his way to mass, he met the Bishop of St David’s. “My lord,”
cried he, “your brethren have presented the most seditious paper
that was ever penned. It is a trumpet of rebellion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Three weeks after, the seven bishops were summoned before the
Privy Council, to answer a charge of high misdemeanour, and
were committed to the Tower. They were conveyed from Whitehall
by water, and were followed by the tears and prayers of thousands.
Both banks of the Thames were lined with multitudes,
who fell on their knees, beseeching God to protect the sufferers
for religion and liberty. The very soldiers in the Tower acted as
mourners; and even the Nonconformists, who had felt all the
bitterness of Episcopal persecution, sent a deputation of ten of
their ministers to wait upon, and condole with the prisoners.
Twenty-eight peers were ready to bail them; and messages were
brought over from Holland, assuring them of the sympathy of the
Prince and Princess of Orange.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>A week later, on the 15th of June, they were brought before
the King’s Bench, by a writ of habeas corpus. An immense concourse
of people received them on the bank of the river, and followed
them to Westminster Hall, the greater part falling upon
their knees, wishing them happiness, and asking their blessing.
Within the court, the bishops found the peers who offered to be
their sureties, and a crowd of gentlemen attached to their interests.
They were charged with a seditious libel. They pleaded “Not
Guilty.” The trial was then postponed for a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the expiration of that time, the bishops again entered Westminster
Hall, surrounded by lords and gentlemen, and followed
by prayers and blessings. The trial began at nine o’clock in the
morning. At seven in the evening, the jury retired to consider
their verdict, and were locked up all night. At nine next morning,
they returned the verdict “Not Guilty.” The noblemen, gentlemen,
and people within the court raised a loud huzza. This
was echoed back by a louder huzza from those without. As the
bishops passed to the river side, there was a lane of people, all on
their knees, to beg their benediction. Sixty earls and lords were
present, joining in the jubilations of the people. At night London
was lighted from end to end with blazing bonfires, all the
church bells were ringing, and the Pope was burned in effigy before
the windows of the royal palace. The excitement was amazing.
James’s popish and despotic reign was doomed. The
royally-applauded atrocities of Judge Jeffreys, which made the
land a shambles, and turned the law itself into the bloodiest of
tyrannies, awoke only groans and muttered curses; but the imprisonment
of seven bishops at once brought about a revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, in the same month that the trial of the bishops
took place, the queen was delivered of a fine healthy boy. The
Lord Mayor of London was commanded to provide bonfires and
other public rejoicings; but there were no bonfires now except for
persecuted bishops, and the alleged birth of a prince, instead of
being honoured, was pronounced to be a gross imposture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Protestants, Tories as well as Whigs, turned to the Prince
of Orange as their only hope, and an invitation was sent to him
to come from Holland, with an armed force, to call in question
the legitimacy of the pretended new born prince, and to redress
the grievances of the nation. Before the month expired, Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>William had collected 15,000 land troops, a fleet of seventy ships,
and a large train of artillery.</p>

<p class='c001'>James began to apprehend danger, and attempted to disarm
the animosity of the people by concessions. He even condescended
to consult with the seven bishops whom he had so recently
harassed. He replaced the Protestant deputy-lieutenants and
magistrates. He gave back to the city of London its old charter,
and restored Compton to his Episcopal office.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 3d of October, the primate and eight bishops waited
upon the king, and endeavoured to bring him back “to the
religion in which he had been baptized and educated;” but,
just at that time, the infant, whose birth had helped to increase
the storm, was baptized, with great pomp, according to the rites
of the Church of Rome. The Pope, represented by his nuncio,
was godfather to the child, and the baptism of James Francis
Edward, with full particulars of the ceremony, was published in
the <cite>Gazette</cite>. This added fresh elements to the storm which was
already raging, and the bastardy of the unlucky child was sung in
scurrilous songs in the streets of London.</p>

<p class='c001'>On October 16th, William of Orange set sail, his ship bearing
the British flag, which was emblazoned with the motto, “I will
maintain the Protestant religion, and the liberties of England.”
James soon found that his game was ended, and that there was
nothing left for him but an ignominious flight. William came
safe to anchor at Torbay, and landed on the 5th of November,
the anniversary of the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot.
Exactly five weeks after, the queen, disguised as an Italian lady,
fled with the infant prince across the Thames to Lambeth, being
lighted on her dolorous way by the flames of burning popish
chapels. From Lambeth, she and her child were conveyed in
a coach to Gravesend, where they entered a yacht, which landed
them at Calais. In less than twenty-four hours the stupified
king fled after them, throwing the great seal of England into the
river as he crossed to the Surrey side. At <a id='corr106.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Feversham'>Faversham</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_106.34'><ins class='correction' title='Feversham'>Faversham</ins></a></span> he embarked
in a custom-house hoy. The boat encountered a storm,
and was obliged to put in at the Isle of Sheppy. There the
people seized the disguised monarch, under the idea that he was a
fugitive Jesuit, treated him with rudeness, and dragged him back
a prisoner to Faversham. At Faversham he was subjected to
further indignities, the mob calling him a “hatchet-faced Jesuit.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>At length he was rescued by Lord Winchelsea out of the rude hands
of sailors, smugglers, and fishermen, and actually came back to
London, and invited his son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, to meet
him, for the purpose of amicably settling the distractions of the
nation. The invitation was declined; and, on December 23d,
James again set sail for France, where he landed two days after;
and thus was England happily delivered from the popish, perfidious,
dissolute, and despotic dynasty of the Stuarts.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Seven weeks afterwards
both Houses of Parliament agreed to the resolution, “That
William and Mary, Prince and Princess of Orange, be, and be
declared, King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, and
the dominions thereto belonging.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in the midst of this national revolution that Samuel
Wesley left the University of Oxford, and became an ordained
clergyman of the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps this digression may be thought too long, and yet, at
the risk of wearying the reader’s patience still further, a few more
sketches of the state of the country, at this momentous period of
its history, are added. They are chiefly taken from Macaulay,
and it is hoped that they may help to convey some idea of the
condition of affairs when Samuel Wesley commenced his ministry.
Things at that time were widely different from what they are at
present, and that must be borne in mind if the reader wishes
rightly to understand the difficulties and discouragements of a
Christian minister like the subject of this biography.</p>

<p class='c001'>London, where Wesley first entered upon the duties of his
sacred office, was, comparatively speaking, a small, dirty, ill-built
town. In the east, no part of the immense line of warehouses and
artificial lakes, which now spreads from the Tower to Blackwall,
had even been projected. On the west, scarcely one of those
stately piles of building, which are inhabited by the noble and
the wealthy, was in existence; and Chelsea, now peopled by tens
of thousands of human beings, was then a quiet country village.
On the north cattle fed, and sportsmen wandered with dogs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>guns over the site of the borough of Marylebone, and over far
the greater space now covered by the boroughs of Finsbury and
the Tower Hamlets. Islington was almost a solitude; and poets
loved to contrast its silence and repose with the din and turmoil
of the monster London. On the south, the capital was connected
with its suburbs by a single line of irregular arches, impeding the
navigation of the river, and overhung by piles of mean and crazy
houses. In Covent Garden a filthy and noisy market was held
close to the dwellings of the great. Fruit women screamed,
carters fought, and cabbage stalks and rotten apples accumulated
in heaps at the thresholds of the Countess of Berkshire and of the
Bishop of Durham. The centre of Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields was an
open space, where the rabble congregated every evening to hear
mountebanks harangue, to see bears dance, and to set dogs at
oxen. St James’s Square was a receptacle for all the offal and
cinders, and for all the dead cats and dead dogs of Westminster.
The pavement of London was detestable, and the drainage so bad
that, in rainy weather, the gutters soon became torrents. The
houses were not numbered. The shops were distinguished by
painted signs, gay and grotesque. The walk from Charing Cross
to Whitechapel lay through an endless succession of Saracens’
Heads, Royal Oaks, Blue Bears, and Golden Lambs. When the
evening closed in, garret windows were opened, and pails were
emptied, with little regard to those who walked on the path below.
Most of the streets were left in profound darkness, where thieves
plied their trade with impunity, and dissolute young gents broke
windows, upset sedans, beat quiet men, and offered rude caresses
to pretty women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing like the London daily newspaper of our time existed,
or could exist. Both the necessary capital and the necessary skill
were wanting. No newspaper was published oftener than twice a
week; and none exceeded in size a single small leaf. The quantity
of matter which one of them contained in a year was not more
than is often found in two numbers of the <cite>Times</cite>. There were no
provincial newspapers whatever. Indeed, except in the capital
and at the two universities, there was scarcely a printer in the
kingdom; and the only printing press in England, north of the
river Trent, appears to have been at York.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the country, many thousands of square miles, now enclosed
and cultivated, were marsh, forest, and heath. The peasant kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>a flock of geese on what is now an orchard rich with apple blossoms.
He snared wild fowl on the fen which has long since been
drained, and divided into corn and turnip fields. He cut turf
among the furze bushes on the moor, which is now a meadow,
bright with clover, and renowned for its butter and its cheese.
The market-place, which the rustic can now reach with his cart
in an hour, was then a day’s journey from his home. On the
best lines of communication, the ruts of the roads were deep, the
descents precipitous, and the way often such as it was hardly
possible to distinguish, in the dusk, from the unenclosed heath and
fen which lay on both sides. It was only in fine weather that
the whole breadth of the road was available; for, in wet, the mud
lay deep both on the right and the left, and only a narrow track
of firm ground rose above the quagmire on each hand. Almost
every day coaches stuck fast, until teams of cattle could be procured
from some neighbouring farm, to tug them out of the slough
in which they were imbedded. On the best highways, heavy goods
were generally conveyed by stage waggons, in the straw of which
nestled a crowd of passengers, who were not able to ride on horseback,
and could not afford to indulge in the luxury of a coach.
The expense of transmitting heavy goods was enormous. From
London to Birmingham, the charge was £7 a ton; and from
London to Exeter it was £12. The cost of conveyance amounted
to a prohibitory tax on many useful articles; and coal, in particular,
was never seen except in the districts where it was
produced, or in the districts to which it was conveyed by water.
On by-roads, and generally throughout the country north of York
and west of Exeter, goods were carried by long trains of pack-horses;
and a traveller of humble condition often found it convenient
to perform a journey, mounted on a pack-saddle, and
seated between two baskets. The rich commonly travelled in their
own carriages, drawn by at least four horses, and often by six, because,
with a less number, there was great danger of sticking fast.
Flying coaches ran thrice a week from London to the chief towns;
but no stage-coach, indeed no stage-waggon, appears to have proceeded
further north than York, or further west than Exeter.
The ordinary day’s journey of a <em>flying</em> coach was about fifty miles
in summer; and in winter, when the roads were bad and the nights
were long, a little more than thirty. In Cornwall, in the fens of
Lincolnshire, and among the hills and lakes of Cumberland, letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>were received only once a-week; the letter-bags being carried on
horseback, day and night, at the rate of about five miles an hour.
Travellers, unless they were numerous and well armed, ran considerable
risk of being stopped and plundered; for the mounted
highwayman was to be found on every main road, held an aristocratic
position in the community of thieves, appeared in fashionable
coffee-houses in the capital, and betted with men of quality
on the race grounds of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most of Samuel Wesley’s life was spent in rural districts; and
therefore amid the marshes, fens, forests, and heaths, the impassable
roads, and the highway dangers just described. He was an
author; but printing presses in the country did not exist. He
was a man of education and of public spirit; but to obtain a newspaper
was almost impossible. He was the head of a family; but
to get coals, and other imported household comforts at Wroote
and at Epworth, was a thing never contemplated. He was a
student; but the difficulty and expense of conveying books from
London to Lincolnshire were so great, that a folio was longer in
reaching its way from Paternoster Row to Epworth, than it now
is in reaching Kentucky. For a poor rector like him to buy and
to get books, was a thing almost impracticable; and to borrow,
such as he wanted, was impossible. Few knights of the shire had
libraries so good as may now universally be found in a servant’s
hall, or in the back parlour of a small shopkeeper. An esquire
passed among his neighbours for a great scholar, if Hudibras,
and Baker’s Chronicles, Tarlton’s Jests, and the Seven Champions
of Christendom, lay in his hall window among his fishing rods and
guns. Many lords of manors, in point of education, differed but
very little from their menial servants; and heirs of estates often
had no better tutors than grooms and gamekeepers, and scarce
attained learning enough to sign their names to a mittimus.
Their chief serious employment was the care of their property.
They examined samples of grain, handled pigs, and, on market
days, made bargains over a tankard with corn merchants and
drovers. Their chief pleasures were commonly derived from field
sports, and from an unrefined sensuality. Their oaths, coarse
jests, and scurrilous terms of abuse were uttered with the broadest
accent of their province; while the litter of their farm-yards
gathered under the windows of their bed-chambers, and cabbages
and gooseberry bushes grew up to their very doors. These were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the kind of country neighbours which Samuel Wesley was privileged
to have for a period of more than forty years.</p>

<p class='c001'>The state of the common people may be judged from the state
of those above them. Four-fifths of them, throughout the country,
were employed in agriculture; and four shillings a-week were
fair agricultural wages. There were few articles, important to
the working man, as coffee, tea, sugar, &amp;c., the price of which
was not double what it is at present. Beer was much cheaper;
and meat was also cheaper; but the latter was even then so dear
that hundreds of thousands of families scarcely knew the taste of
it. Bread, such as is now given to the inmates of a workhouse,
was then seldom seen, even on the trencher of a shopkeeper or of
a yeoman. The great majority of the nation lived almost entirely
on rye, oats, and barley. Such was the general condition of
Samuel Wesley’s Lincolnshire parishioners.</p>

<p class='c001'>We refrain, at present, from any lengthy remarks respecting
the religion and morals of the nation. It may be added, however,
that the manners of the people were exceedingly coarse and
vicious. The discipline of workshops, of schools, and of private
families was harsh to an extreme. The implacability of hostile
factions was such as, at the present day, we can scarcely conceive.
Sufferers by the law experienced but little mercy. Put an
offender in the pillory, and it was well if he escaped with his life
from the showers of stones and brick-bats thrown at him. Tie
him to the cart’s tail, and the crowd pressed round him, begging
the hangman to give it to the fellow well, and to make him howl.
Fights, compared with which a boxing match is a refined and
humane spectacle, were among the favourite diversions of a large
part of the town. Multitudes assembled to see gladiators hack
each other in pieces; and shouted with delight when one of the
combatants lost a finger or an eye. Prisons were hells on earth,
and seminaries of every disease and of every crime.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would not be difficult to multiply such facts as these; but
enough has been said to show that when Samuel Wesley began
his ministry, England and the English people were very different
from what they are at present. The Christian minister even now
has difficulties and discouragements; but, as a rule, he is almost a
stranger to the trials encountered by young Wesley. For a penny
he has his newspaper every morning; and for a trifle more he has
his monthly review and magazine. He lives in an age when even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the poorest of his parishioners will hardly deign to ride in the
stage-waggon, but all aspire to be conveyed by the swift railway
train. Books are published by millions; and circulating libraries,
in one shape or in another, may be found in almost every hamlet
of the land. Education is general; and not merely country squires,
but country peasants, study classical and scientific books. Work
is plentiful; and, except in a few bucolic districts, wages are sufficient
to make the poor man’s cottage a neat and a happy home.
It was otherwise one hundred and seventy-seven years ago, when
Samuel Wesley, a young man of twenty-six years of age, first
entered upon the office and duties of a clergyman of the Church
of England.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br />ORDINATION AND MARRIAGE—1688–1689.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr Wesley took his degree of Bachelor of Arts at Oxford on the
19th of June 1688. Exactly seven weeks afterwards, he was
ordained a deacon of the Church of England. He writes: “I tarried
in Exeter College, though I met with some hardships I had
before been unacquainted with, till I was of standing sufficient to
take my Bachelor’s degree; and not being able to subsist there
afterwards, I came to London during the time of my Lord Bishop
of London’s suspension by the High Commission, and was instituted
into deacon’s orders by my Lord Bishop of Rochester, at his
palace at Bromley, August 7, 1688.” It is an incident worth
remembering, that Mr Wesley left Oxford during the trial of the
seven bishops, and was ordained amid the intense excitement
which arose out of that event.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the above quotation he makes mention of his “hardships”
in Exeter College. We are left to guess what the hardships were;
but remembering that, when he entered, all the money he had was
only about forty shillings—remembering that he remained in the
college for nearly five years,—and remembering that, for that,
length of time, he had to support himself by serving others; and
that the only assistance he received from his friends was a five
shillings piece, there can be no difficulty in perceiving that his
collegiate life must have been no ordinary struggle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was ordained a deacon at Bromley by the Bishop of
Rochester, the well-known Dr Thomas Sprat. This prelate was a
man of considerable eminence. He began life as a fellow of Wadham
College, Oxford, where, on the death of Oliver Cromwell, he
gave a specimen of his poetical talents in an “Ode to the Happy
Memory of the late Lord Protector.” He subsequently became a
fellow of the Royal Society, chaplain to George, Duke of Buckingham,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>chaplain in ordinary to King Charles II., canon of Windsor,
Dean of Westminster, clerk of the closet to King James II., dean
of the Chapel Royal, and Bishop of Rochester. He was an intimate
friend of the poet Cowley, who, by his last will, left to his care his
printed works and MSS. His preferment to the bench of bishops
was considered as a reward for the service he rendered in drawing
up, at the command of King Charles II., an account of the Rye
House Plot. His known sympathy for James II. brought upon
him a large amount of popular indignation; so much so that, at
the trial of the seven bishops, while the air rang with loud huzzas
for the persecuted prelates, it was also filled with execrations
against Sprat and his fawning associates. Strangely enough, it
was just at this time that Sprat ordained Samuel Wesley. An
odd incident happened four years afterwards. His principles being
so well known, Bishop Sprat was involved with others in an information
laid before the Privy Council of a pretended conspiracy
for restoring James II. Sprat was arrested, and kept under a
strict guard for eleven days, but effectually cleared himself of the
accusation. He was so much affected, however, by the danger to
which it had exposed him, that, to the end of his days, he commemorated
his deliverance by an annual thanksgiving. He died in
1713. Though somewhat of a time-server, he was a man of great
ability. Dunton, in his “Characters of Eminent Conformists,” is
most extravagant in praising him: his style is matchless, his wit
flowing, his thoughts deep, and his poems beautiful.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Samuel Wesley was ordained a priest of the Church of England,
by Dr Compton, in St Andrew’s Church, Holborn, on February 24,
1689. This was twelve days after the Prince and Princess of
Orange were declared by parliament to be King and Queen of
Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Compton was a man even more remarkable than Sprat. He was
the youngest son of Spencer, Earl of Northampton. On leaving
the university, he went to the Continent, for the purpose of perfecting
himself in the modern languages. After the restoration
of Charles II., he became cornet of a regiment of horse; but soon
resigned his commission, and devoted himself to the service of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>church. He successively became Canon-commoner of Christ-Church
College, Rector of Cottenham, Master of St Crosse’s
Hospital, Canon of Christ-Church, Bishop of Oxford, Dean of the
Royal Chapel, and finally Bishop of the diocese of London. He
was intrusted with the education of the two princesses, Mary and
Anne, whom he also afterwards married to the Princes of Orange
and Denmark; and their firmness in the Protestant religion was
in a great measure owing to his instructions. For his steadfast
opposition to Popery, and for refusing to become an instrument of
ecclesiastical tyranny among the clergy of his diocese, he was suspended,
by James II., from his Episcopal office, his name was
struck from the list of the Privy Council, and he was deprived of
his office as Dean of the Royal Chapel. His suspension was the
reason why Samuel Wesley was ordained a deacon by the chameleon-like
Dr Sprat. On the invasion of the Prince of Orange,
he was restored to his Episcopal functions; he performed the ceremony
of crowning King William and Queen Mary; was appointed
one of the Commissioners for revising the Liturgy; and laboured
with much zeal to reconcile Dissenters to the Established Church.
His spirit of moderation made him unpopular with the clergy, and,
in all probability, checked his further promotion. He died in the
same year as Bishop Sprat, at the age of eighty-one. Through the
whole of a long life, he was exemplary in his moral conduct, and
displayed the manners of a gentleman. He was a warm friend, a
generous patron, a respectable writer, a faithful bishop, but a dull
and inanimate preacher. Such were the two prelates who ordained
Samuel Wesley.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time that Mr Wesley entered upon his ministerial career,
there were, in the English Church, some of the most distinguished
divines that it has ever had. There was Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester,
a prelate of great learning and piety, and whose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Origines
Sacræ”</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Origines Britannicæ”</span> are still held in high esteem.
There was Tillotson, the son of a Yorkshire clothier, who was raised
to the see of Canterbury, and whose sermons, when published, were
regarded as a standard of finished oratory, and still rank among
the most popular in the English language. There was the godly
Thomas Kenn, Bishop of Bath and Wells, the well-known author of
the “Morning and Evening Hymns.” There was William Sancroft,
who took an active part in repairing St Paul’s Cathedral after the
dilapidations of the civil wars, and in rebuilding it after the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>fire of London; one of the seven bishops, who, for bearding King
James II., was committed to the Tower; and who, for refusing the
oath of allegiance to King William, lost his archbishopric; a timorous,
but well-meaning man, laborious in his studies, and who is said
to have written more with his own hand than any other person of
his time. There was Robert South, a man of immense talents,
though of harsh temper and ungoverned wit. There was Gilbert
Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, a most industrious writer, and author
of the “History of the Reformation.” There was John Sharp,
Archbishop of York, an able preacher, and the author of seven
volumes of valuable sermons. There was Thomas Tennison, Archbishop
of Canterbury, who had the esteem of King James, attended
Queen Mary during her last moments, faithfully reproved
King William for his immoral practices, and officiated at the
coronation of Queen Anne and of King George I.,—an able opponent
of the infidel opinions of Hobbes; a defender of the Established
Church against Popery; though not a brilliant, yet a clear
and argumentative writer; and though a plain yet a forcible
preacher. There was William Beveridge, Bishop of St Asaph, an
eminent Oriental scholar, a distinguished theologian, and a man of
great goodness and simplicity. There was White Kennett, a man
of great literary labours, his judgment solid, his style easy, and
who died Bishop of the diocese of Peterborough. There was Daniel
Whitby, profoundly learned, who, in 1703, published in two volumes
folio his able “Commentary on the New Testament,” the result of
fifteen years of close application. There was George Hooper, Bishop
of Bath and Wells, and greatly distinguished both as a writer and
divine. William Fleetwood, Bishop of Ely, an active prelate, an
eloquent preacher, and a learned, industrious, and able writer.
William Derham, the able author of “Physico-Theology.” William
Lowth, amiable and erudite, and the father of the bishop of
that name. Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, a man of
respectable scientific and classical attainments, but distinguished
most for his Christian benevolence. Others might be mentioned,
and, besides these, a large number of other clergy, who, though
not so eminent for their learning and literary productions, were
quite equal for unassuming and zealous piety.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is scarce credible that, with such bishops at the head of the
English Church, there should not be hundreds of quiet, godly,
earnest, useful ministers, acting under them, all of them of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>same sterling character as Samuel Wesley. It is a great mistake
to imagine that, up to the time of Samuel Wesley’s sons, John and
Charles, the English clergy were, almost without exception, ignorant,
indolent, heterodox, worldly, and wicked. Doubtless there
were a large number of such men; but there were likewise a large
number of another and much better class.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same period, the Dissenters also had a considerable
number of able and useful preachers. For example, there was
Daniel Williams, the most influential Presbyterian minister of his
day; the successor of Richard Baxter at Pinner’s Hall, the author
of six volumes of cumbrous controversy, and the founder of the
magnificent library of Red Cross Street. There was Daniel Burgess,
extremely popular on account of his quaint and familiar style
of pulpit oratory. There was Benjamin Keach, once sentenced
to stand in the pillory for publishing his “Child’s Instructor,”
and whose “Travels of True Godliness” and “Scripture Metaphors”
have been read by myriads; a man whom Dunton
represents as mounted upon an Apocalyptic Beast, with Babylon
before him, Zion behind him, and a hundred thousand bulls and
bears roaring and ramping round about him. There was Vincent
Alsop, a man of piety and worth, with a glowing fancy and a
lively wit. There was Matthew Henry, whose labours as a preacher
were almost incessant, and who yet found time to write one of
the largest and most useful Expositions of the Holy Bible ever
published. There was Matthew Sylvester, a man of “godly life
and great ability in the ministerial work,” to whom, as an intimate
friend, Baxter left his “MS. Narrative of his Life and
Times.” And there were also still surviving not a few of the
noble Nonconformist ministers ejected in 1662.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Samuel Wesley was not only a Christian minister, but likewise
an author of considerable eminence, this attempt at photographing
portraits will scarce be perfect, without a passing glance
at the literary and other celebrities, who were flourishing at the
time of Wesley’s ordination, and with some of whom he ran a
literary race.</p>

<p class='c001'>Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, was just rising into fame and
power, and preparing the way for the high position which he
occupied during the reign of Anne. John Churchill, Duke of
Marlborough, was just appointed commander-in-chief of the British
forces. George Byng, the celebrated admiral, was beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to display the bravery and the naval skill for which he is still
remembered. John Radcliffe, the renowned physician, had recently
removed to London, where he received from King William, during
the first six years of his reign, nearly eight thousand guineas for
his professional assistance. Isaac Newton, the unrivalled philosopher,
was just elected one of the representatives of the Cambridge
University. Sir Hans Sloane was bringing home eight
hundred species of plants from the West Indies. Richard Bentley,
the son of a Yorkshire blacksmith, had just removed with his
pupil, Stillingfleet’s son, to the Oxford University, having already
evinced his amazing powers as a scholar and a critic. Matthew
Prior was writing his poem on the Deity. Jonathan Swift, having
lost his uncle, and being almost penniless, was applying, by the
advice of his mother, to the celebrated Sir William Temple to
afford him shelter, and to find him bread. William Penn was
writing his prolix “Maxims and Reflections on Human Life.” Sir
Godfrey Kneller, with King James before him, was painting a
portrait of that monarch at the very moment when the landing of
Prince William was announced. Grinling Gibbons, whom Evelyn
considers the greatest of all sculptors, was at the zenith of his
fame. Sir Christopher Wren was building St Paul’s Cathedral.
Dryden, deprived of his official emoluments by the abdication of
King James, was now writing for bread, and producing some of
the finest pieces he ever published. John Locke, whom Dr Watts
describes as having a soul wide as the sea, calm as the night, and
bright as the day, was finishing his immortal “Essay on the
Human Understanding.” And Robert Boyle, not unworthy to be
ranked with Lord Bacon, acquainted with the whole compass of
mathematical sciences, and from whose works may be deduced
the whole system of natural knowledge, was, as usual, regulating,
by a thermometer, the quantity of clothes he ought to wear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were some of the illustrious men flourishing at this period.
We shall meet with others farther on.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley’s first ecclesiastical appointment was a curacy, with
an income of £28 a-year. He was then appointed chaplain on
board a man-of-war, where his salary was at the rate of £70
a-year, and where he began his poem on the Life of Christ. He
then obtained another curacy in London, his ecclesiastical income
during the two years’ service that he rendered, being £30 per
annum, an amount which he doubled by his industry and writings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>It was while he held this appointment that he married, he and his
wife living in lodgings, until after the birth of their first-born,
Samuel.</p>

<p class='c001'>The young lady, who became Mr Wesley’s wife, was Susanna
Annesley, the daughter of Dr Annesley, one of the leading Nonconformist
ministers of London.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Annesley was born at Haseley in Warwickshire, in the year
1620. His father was cousin of the Earl of Anglesea, and died
when Samuel was but four years of age. His education devolved
on his pious mother, who brought him up in the fear of God.
From his early childhood his heart was set on preaching; and, to
qualify himself for that sacred work, he began, when he was only
five or six years old, seriously to read the Bible; and such was his
ardour that he bound himself to read twenty chapters daily, a
practice which he continued to the end of life. Though a child,
he never varied from his purpose to become a preacher; nor was
he discouraged by a dream, in which “he thought he was a minister,
and was sent for by the Bishop of London to be burnt as a
martyr.” At fifteen years of age, he went to Queen’s College,
Oxford, and there took the degree of LL.D. When he was twenty-four
he became chaplain of his Majesty’s ship <cite>Globe</cite>, under the
command of the Earl of Warwick. Not liking a seafaring life,
he left the navy, and settled at Cliff in Kent, in the place of a
minister who had been sequestered for his scandalous living; but
of whom the rude and ignorant parishioners were so extremely
fond, that when Annesley, his successor, first went among them,
they assailed him with spits, forks, and stones, threatening to take
away his life. In a few years his labours had surprising success,
and the people were greatly reformed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In July 1648, he was called to London to preach the fast sermon
before the House of Commons, which, by imperial order, was
printed. In 1652, he relinquished his living at Cliff, which was
worth £400 a year, and became minister of the Church of St
John the Apostle in London. Five years after he was made lecturer
at St Paul’s, and, in 1658, became vicar and “soul-servant,”
as he terms himself, of St Giles’s, Cripplegate. He now had two
of the largest congregations in the city. The Cripplegate living
was worth £700 per annum.</p>

<p class='c001'>With two thousand other ministers he was ejected by the Act
of Uniformity, and had his fair share of subsequent persecution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>One magistrate, while signing a warrant to apprehend him, dropped
down dead.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Annesley was a large-hearted man, and was extensively
useful. He had the care of all the Nonconformist churches in the
capital upon him; and was the chief instrument in the education
and subsistence of several ministers, of whose useful labours the
church would otherwise have been deprived.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1672, when King Charles, for the sake of the Papists, unconstitutionally
suspended for a little while the penal laws in
matters of religion, Dr Annesley licensed a meeting-house in St
Helen’s Place, Bishopsgate Street, where he raised a large and
flourishing church, of which he continued the pastor until his
death. He was the main support of the morning lecture, and
always laid aside a tenth part of his income for charitable purposes.
He had a weekly meeting of ministers in his vestry at St
Helen’s Place; and, once a month, there were Latin disputations
upon theology; but, as these engendered heated debates among
the ministers, they were dropped. In the same meeting-house at
St Helen’s Place, Edmund Calamy was ordained in 1694, his
being the first <em>public</em> ordination among the Dissenters for more
than thirty years. Dr Annesley and five other ministers took
part in the ordination service, which lasted nearly nine hours,
from before ten o’clock in the morning to past six o’clock at night.
During the last thirty years of his life he had uninterrupted peace
of spirit, arising from an uninterrupted assurance of God’s forgiving
love. He closed his useful ministry, of more than fifty-five
years’ continuance, December 31st, 1696. His death occurred
in Spittal Yard, and he lies interred in the burial-ground of St
Leonard’s, Shoreditch. His funeral sermon was preached by the
Rev. Daniel Williams, and, in an enlarged form, was published by
Dunton in 1697, making a small volume of one hundred and fifty
pages. Williams states in the biography, that Annesley was of
so hale and hardy a constitution, as to endure the coldest weather
without using hat, gloves, or fire. For many years he seldom
drank anything but water, and, to the day of his death, he could
read the smallest print without spectacles. He was an eminently
useful man, and, in most things, a pattern worthy of imitation. A
short time before he died his joy was such that he exclaimed, “I
cannot contain it. What manner of love is this to a poor worm!
I cannot express the thousandth part of the praise due to Christ.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>I’ll praise Thee, and rejoice that there are others that can praise
Thee better!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The celebrated Richard Baxter, who was no eulogist, remarks:—“Dr
Annesley is a most sincere, godly, humble man,—an
Israelite indeed: one that may be said to be sanctified from the
womb.” Dunton, his son-in-law, says—“He was a man of wonderful
piety and humility. The great business and the pleasure
of his life was to persuade sinners back to God. His Nonconformity
created him many troubles; but they never altered the
goodness and cheerfulness of his humour.” Daniel Defoe was
one of his congregation, and wrote an elegy respecting him, which
Dunton published. Defoe, speaking of his early piety, says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His pious course with childhood he began,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was his Maker’s sooner than his own:</div>
      <div class='line'>The heavenly book he made his only school—</div>
      <div class='line'>In youth his study, and in age his rule.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Moses, for humility and zeal;</div>
      <div class='line'>For innocence, a true Nathaniel;</div>
      <div class='line'>Faithful as Abraham, or the truer spies;</div>
      <div class='line'>No man more honest, and but few so wise:</div>
      <div class='line'>Humility was his darling grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And honesty sat regent in his face.</div>
      <div class='line'>A heavenly patience did his mind possess—</div>
      <div class='line'>Cheerful in pain, and thankful in distress.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Dr Annesley had a large family. Dunton relates that when Dr
Manton was baptizing one of Annesley’s children, he was asked
how many more he had? he replied, he believed it was either two
dozen or a quarter of a hundred. Of these four or five-and-twenty
young Annesleys, however, Dr Clark could find not more than the
names of seven—viz, Samuel, Benjamin, Judith, Sarah, Ann,
Elizabeth, and Susanna. Samuel went abroad in the service of
the East India Company, accumulated a considerable fortune, and
intended to return to England; but, all at once, he suddenly disappeared,
and no account was ever received, either of his person
or of his property. The probability is that he was robbed and
murdered.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Benjamin Annesley was “an ingenuous youth,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>was appointed an executor of his father’s will. Judith was eminently
pious, and loved good books more than other young ladies
loved fine clothes. She was exceedingly beautiful; and refused
to marry a gentleman of splendid fortune because he was addicted
to his cups. Of Sarah, we find no information. Ann was a wit,
and was as fine a woman as nature and art ever formed. She
married Mr James Fremantle; and Dunton says, she was the only
person he ever knew whom an estate made more humble. Her
life was one continued act of tenderness, wit, and piety. Elizabeth
Annesley will be mentioned hereafter. Susanna became the wife
of Samuel Wesley.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having sketched the life of the father of Susanna Wesley, a
few lines must be devoted to her mother. It is a remarkable
fact, that as the father of Samuel Wesley’s mother was named
John White, so the father of Susanna Wesley’s mother was named
John White also. Both of them were men of mark. John White,
“the Patriarch of Dorchester,” is brought before the reader in
Chapter II. The other John White, the grandfather of Susanna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Wesley, is too important a character to be overlooked. He was
the son of Henry White, of Heylan, in Pembrokeshire, where he
was born, June 29, 1590. He entered Jesus College, Oxford,
when about seventeen years of age; and, after completing his
studies, was admitted to the Middle Temple, and, in due time,
became a member of the Bar, and a bencher of that society. While
a barrister, he was much employed by the Puritans in the purchase
of impropriations, which were to be given to those of their own
party. In 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for the
borough of Southwark. He now joined in all the proceedings
which led to the overthrow of the Established Church. He was
appointed chairman of the Committee for Religion, and was also a
member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines. In a speech of
his, made in the House of Commons, and published in 1641, he
contends that the office of bishop and presbyter is the same; and
that the offices of deacons, chancellors, vicars, surrogates, and
registrars, are all of human origin, and ought to be abolished, as
being altogether superfluous and of no service to the Church. He
says that Episcopacy had been intrusted with the care of souls for
more than eighty years; and now, as a consequence, nearly four-fifths
of the churches throughout the kingdom were held by idle
or scandalous ministers. He alleges that, even during the present
parliament, the House of Commons and its committees had been
furnished with abundant evidence that it was of no use to report
“scandalous ministers” to their bishops, for they received no censure,
save a harmless admonition; while, on the other hand, if the
bishops happened to discover a godly and learned preacher within
the limits of their diocese, they did their utmost to scatter his
congregation, and to expel him from his church. He admits that
some of the bishops are good men; but the bishops who are good
men, are all bad bishops,—a sufficient proof, in his estimation, that
the very office is itself a curse.</p>

<p class='c001'>The speech, from which the above is taken, fills fourteen small
quarto pages, is full of texts of Scripture, and as dry as a lawyer’s
eloquence could make it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As already stated, John White was appointed chairman of the
Committee for Religion. It was the duty of that committee to
receive all petitions of parishioners against their pastors, with lists
of ministerial misdemeanours. In 1643, one hundred examples
of those <em>scandalous clergy</em> were drawn up by White, and were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>published in a book, entitled, “The First Century of Scandalous,
Malignant Priests.” In the preface, White says, “The ensuing
summary declaration of the grounds whereupon Parliament had
proceeded against divers ministers to sequester their benefices from
them, and place in their room godly and learned preachers of the
Word of God, may serve many excellent purposes—as 1, To show
that the Episcopal form of church government is evil, and that
parliament had good cause to abolish it; 2, That the bishops had
not only neglected their duties, but had appointed to benefices
drunkards, whoremongers, and adulterers; 3, The book will show
what sort of men the clergy are who favour the king; and 4, The
cause of the general ignorance and debauchery of the gentry and
people of this kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>White then gives the one hundred examples of scandalous parsons.
These examples now lie before us, but they are too gross
and defiling to be reprinted. The curious reader, anxious to know
what they are, may find them in the British Museum, bound up
in a volume, given to the Museum by George III. The pamphlet
is quarto, and contains fifty-seven pages. White promised to publish
a “Second Century” of cases, but he either was unable to find
sufficient materials, or perhaps his intention was frustrated by his
death, which occurred a few months after. Eight thousand clergy
were ejected from their livings during the civil wars, on the ground
of heterodoxy, viciousness of life, superstition, or malignancy against
parliament: but White has given the character of one hundred
only. Clarendon says, that petitions were often presented by a few
of the rabble, and against the general sense and judgment of the
parish. He avers that many were designated “scandalous clergy,”
who were men of great gravity and learning, and who lived the
most unblemished lives. He adds, that White was “a grave lawyer,
but notoriously disaffected to the Church.” Of course Clarendon
knew the men, but his party feeling was such that what he
says requires to be received with caution.</p>

<p class='c001'>John White died shortly after the publication of his “First
Century of Scandalous, Malignant Priests,” viz., on the 29th of
January 1644, and was buried in the Temple Church, where a
marble stone was afterwards placed upon his grave, with this inscription:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here lyeth a John, a burning, shining light,</div>
      <div class='line'>His name, life, actions, were all <em>White</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Such was the grandfather of Susanna Wesley. Her mother
was one of whom but very little has been left on record. She
was a woman of sincere piety. She conscientiously endeavoured
to bring up her children in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord. She was greatly loved by her husband, and both lie buried
in the same sacred grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the faithful and beautiful portraiture of Susanna Wesley,
recently published by the Rev. John Kirk, it would be worse than
superfluous to relate her history here. We wish that her letters
were published in a collected form, not only because of their
intrinsic excellence, but also because they would help to depict
her refined intellect and her earnest piety. She was in all
respects a remarkable woman. Like her father, she was godly
from childhood. When she died, in 1742, her sons had four
verses inscribed on her tombstone, teaching, if they teach anything,
that she was not received into the divine favour until she
attained the age of seventy. This is a monstrous perversion of
facts, and can only be accounted for on the ground that John and
Charles Wesley were so enamoured of their blessed and newly-discovered
doctrines, that as yet they felt it difficult to think any
one to be scripturally converted except those who had obtained a
sense of pardon, and had experienced an instantaneous change of
heart, under circumstances similar to their own. If Susanna
Wesley was not converted many a long year previous to her death,
and previous to the conversion of her sons, we have yet to learn
what conversion is. Having read her letters and her other literary
productions, we are satisfied that, if there ever was a sincere and
earnest Christian, she was one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her intellectual was as remarkable as her Christian character.
Let any one read her writings, and, unless he is blinded with prejudice,
he will willingly acknowledge that, for vigorous thought,
mental discipline, clearness of apprehension, logical acumen, extensive
theological knowledge, purity of style, and force of utterance,
Susanna Wesley has few superiors. She was not a poetess,
but, if such language may be used concerning a lady, she was an
accomplished scholar, a learned student, a correct philosopher,
and a profound divine. Dr A. Clarke observes, “She appears to
have had the advantage of a liberal education, as far as Latin,
Greek, and French enter into such an education.” Though her
knowledge of these languages might be far from perfect, yet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fact itself may be taken as an indication of the mental energy of
her character, for at that period female education was most scandalously
neglected. Macaulay writes, “The literary stores of the
lady of the manor and her daughters generally consisted of a
prayer-book and a book of receipts. The English women of that
generation were decidedly worse educated than they have been at
any other time since the revival of learning. If a damsel had the
least smattering of literature she was regarded as a prodigy.
Ladies highly born, highly bred, and naturally quick-witted, were
unable to write a line in their mother tongue without solecisms
and faults of spelling, such as a charity girl would now be
ashamed to commit. One instance will suffice. Queen Mary had
good natural abilities, had been educated by a bishop, was fond of
history and poetry, and was regarded by very eminent men as a
superior woman, and yet there is in the library of the Hague a
superb English Bible, which was delivered to her when she was
crowned in Westminster Abbey, in the title page of which are
these words, in her own hand, ‘This book was given the King
and <em>I</em> at our <em>crownation</em>.—<span class='sc'>Marie R.</span>’” In such an age Susanna
Annesley acquired an education embracing in its compass Latin,
Greek, and French.</p>

<p class='c001'>We pass over the management of her children, and simply add
that, as a wife, she was affectionate and obedient. Writing of her
husband, after they had been more than thirty years married, she
says, “Since I have taken my husband, ‘for better for worse,’ I’ll
take my residence with him; ‘where he lives will I live, and
where he dies will I die, and there will I be buried.’ God do so
unto me, and more also if aught but death part him and me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No wonder that Samuel Wesley was passionately attached to
such a wife. She was in her person not only graceful but beautiful.
Sir Peter Lely, the painter of the “beauties” of his age, has
left a portrait of her sister Judith, representing her as a lady of
rare charms; and yet one who knew them both has said, “Beautiful
as Miss Annesley appears, she was far from being as beautiful
as Mrs Wesley.” If her husband had not loved and respected
her as much as she loved and respected him, he would have been
unworthy of her. Four years after their marriage, and when
cooped up in the miserable little parsonage at South Ormsby, Mr
Wesley published his “Life of Christ,” in which there is the following
poetic portrait of his noble-hearted wife, and of the sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>life they lived in their humble hut, near the shores of the German
sea:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She graced my humble roof, and blest my life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blest me by a far greater name than wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet still I bore an undisputed sway,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was’t her task, but pleasure, to obey;</div>
      <div class='line'>Scarce thought, much less could act, what I denied,</div>
      <div class='line'>In our low house there was no room for pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor need I e’er direct what still was right,</div>
      <div class='line'>She studied my convenience and delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor did I for her care ungrateful prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>But only used my power to show my love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Whate’er she asked I gave, without reproach or grudge,</div>
      <div class='line'>For still she reason asked, and I was judge.</div>
      <div class='line'>All my commands, requests at her fair hands,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her requests to me were all commands.</div>
      <div class='line'>To others thresholds rarely she’d incline.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her house her pleasure was, and she was mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rarely abroad, or never, but with me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or when by pity called, or charity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Such was the nuptial life of Samuel and Susanna Wesley.
They were married about the year 1689, but where and by whom
there is no evidence to show. For about forty-six years they
bravely battled with their domestic trials, and, after a seven years’
separation, were, in 1742, reunited in that happy world, where
“the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.”
“No man,” says Southey, “was ever more suitably mated than
Samuel Wesley. The wife whom he chose was, like himself, the
child of a man eminent among the Nonconformists, and, like himself,
in early life she had chosen her own path. She had examined
the controversy between the Dissenters and the Church of England
with conscientious diligence, and satisfied herself that the schismatics
were in the wrong. She had reasoned herself into Socinianism,
from which her husband reclaimed her. She was an
admirable woman, an obedient wife, an exemplary mother, and a fervent
Christian. The marriage was blest in all its circumstances;
it was contracted in the prime of their youth; it was fruitful and
death did not divide them till they were full of days.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1691 or thereabouts, Mr Wesley was appointed to the parish
of South Ormsby, a neat Lincolnshire village, about eight miles
north-west of Spilsby. It is pleasantly situated, and, in 1821,
the parish, including the adjoining hamlet of Kettlesby, contained
thirty-six dwelling-houses, and two hundred and sixty-one inhabitants,
a population probably quite equal to what it was in the
days of Samuel Wesley. The church consists of a tower, a nave,
and a chancel, with a small chapel on the northern side, and is
dedicated to St Leonard.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This was no serious charge for a young clergyman of twenty-eight
years of age, and possessed of learning and ability like those
of Samuel Wesley; yet here, among his flock of two hundred men,
women, and children, he resided and faithfully laboured for about
the next five years. The living was obtained for him without
any solicitation on his part, by the Marquis of Normanby. Its
emoluments were £50 a year, and a house to live in.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The house
was little better than a mud-built hut, and Samuel Wesley in describing
it and his own life in it, writes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In a mean cot, composed of reeds and clay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wasting in sighs the uncomfortable day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Near where the inhospitable Humber roars,</div>
      <div class='line'>Devouring by degrees, the neighbouring shores.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let earth go where it will, I’ll not repine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can unhappy be, while heaven is mine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Here, in this miserable hovel, Wesley and his noble young wife
resided. Here five of their children were born, and here Wesley
wrote some of the most able works he ever published. Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Wesley was one of the rural clergy, but differed widely from the
great mass of his brethren, who are thus described by Macaulay:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The rural clergyman, generally, began life as a young Levite,
who every day said grace, at the table of a coarse ignorant squire,
in full canonicals; and received, as pay, his board, a small garret,
and ten pounds a year. In fine weather, he was always ready for
bowls; and in rainy weather, for shovelboard. Sometimes he
nailed up apricots, and sometimes curried coach horses, and cast
up farriers’ bills. He was permitted to dine with the family; but
was expected to content himself with the plainest fare. A waiting
woman was generally considered as the most suitable help-meet
for him. Quitting his chaplainship for a benefice and a
wife, he found he had only exchanged one class of vexations for
another. Often it was only by toiling on his glebe, by feeding
swine, and by loading dungcarts, that he could obtain daily bread;
nor did his utmost exertions always prevent the bailiffs from taking
his concordance and his inkstand in execution. It was a
white day on which he was admitted into the kitchen of a great
house, and regaled by the servants with cold meat and ale. His
children were brought up like the children of the neighbouring
peasants. His boys followed the plough, and his girls were sent out
to service. Study he found to be impossible, for the advowson of
his living would hardly have sold for a sum sufficient to purchase
a good theological library; and he might be considered as unusually
lucky, if he had ten or twelve dog-cared volumes among the pots
and pans on his household shelves. It is true that at that time
(1685) there was no lack in the English Church of ministers
distinguished by abilities and learning; but these men were to be
found, with scarce a single exception, at the universities, at the
great cathedrals, or in the capital. Barrow had lately died at
Cambridge, and Pearson had gone thence to the Episcopal bench.
Cudworth and Henry More were still living there; South and
Pococke, Jane and Aldrich were at Oxford. Prideaux was at Norwich,
and Whitby at Salisbury. In London were Sherlock, Tillotson,
Sprat, Wake, Jeremy Collier, Burnett, Stillingfleet, Fowler,
Sharp, Tennison, and Beveridge. Of these, ten became bishops and
four archbishops. Thus the Anglican priesthood was divided into
two sections—one trained for cities and courts, comprising men
familiar with all ancient and modern learning; men able to encounter
Hobbes or Bossuet at all the weapons of controversy; men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>who could, in their sermons, set forth the majesty and beauty of
Christianity with such justness of thought, and such energy of language,
that the indolent Charles roused himself to listen, and the
fastidious Buckingham forgot to sneer; men with whom Halifax
loved to discuss the interests of empires, and from whom Dryden
was not ashamed to own that he had learned to write. The other
section was destined to render humbler service. It was dispersed
over the country, and consisted chiefly of persons not at all wealthier,
and not much more refined, than small farmers or upper
servants. And yet, it was in these rustic priests, who derived
their scanty subsistence from their tithe sheaves and tithe pigs,
and who had not the smallest chance of ever attaining high professional
honours, that the professional spirit was strongest.
Among those divines, who were the boast of the universities, and
the delight of the capital, a party leaned towards constitutional
principles of government, lived on friendly terms with Presbyterians,
Independents, and Baptists, would gladly have seen a full
toleration granted to all Protestant sects, and would even have
consented to make alterations in the Liturgy, for the purpose of
conciliating honest and candid Nonconformists. But such latitudinarianism
was held in horror by the country parson. He was,
indeed, prouder of his ragged gown than his superiors of their
lawn and of their scarlet hoods. The very consciousness that
there was little in his worldly circumstances to distinguish him
from the villagers to whom he preached, led him to hold immoderately
high the dignity of that sacerdotal office, which was his
single title to reverence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We raise no objection to this graphic description of the country
clergy living about the time that Samuel Wesley was appointed to
South Ormsby. We believe it to be strictly accurate; and yet to
all general rules there are exceptions, and, in this instance, Samuel
Wesley was one. It is true that he was poor and pinched. It is
quite possible that he sometimes found it necessary to load his
dungcart, plough his glebe, and feed his swine; but Samuel Wesley
was not the man to waste his time at bowls and shovelboard; or
to stoop to the indignity of being regaled, by servants, with cold
meat and ale, in the kitchen of the squire’s forbidden hall. His
children might be coarsely clad, but his boys never followed the
plough, nor did his girls go out to service. His fifty pounds a year
might afford him next to nothing to buy books; and yet, somehow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>he read most of the best books in the English language. He was
most faithfully devoted to the service of the Church; but he was far
too great a man to think that the mere accidents of the sacerdotal
office were sufficient to raise him above his neighbours. He was
a country parson; but in learning, mental abilities, and the faithful
discharge of ministerial duties, he differed from his country
brethren, and was not unworthy to be ranked and associated with
the greatest men at that time flourishing in the universities, in
cathedrals, and in the capital. He might, like hundreds of others,
have spent his time in agricultural toils and village sports, but
there was within him the stirring of a high-born genius, which,
wherever it exists, invariably impels its possessor to rise above the
mediocrity of the common herd, and to attempt something honourable
to the man who does it, and of service to those on whose
behalf he labours. Human humdrums have always been inconveniently
numerous, but Samuel Wesley was not one of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>As already stated, he was the clergyman of an obscure village,
with about two hundred inhabitants. There was plenty of opportunity
to live a lazy life. He might have droned away his time,
and wasted “the uncomfortable day in sighs;” but, like all men of
genius and of mark, he could be happy only by being hard at work.
His scanty income, and his increasing family, might be one of the
inducements which led him to devote himself to literary labour;
but had his income been even larger than his necessities required,
it is almost certain that he would have pursued the same course of
conduct; for, to a literary man, literary labour is not merely toil,
but likewise luxury.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s first publication was the “Maggots,” already
noticed. His next undertaking was the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, projected
by his brother-in-law, John Dunton, just before Wesley removed
from London to South Ormsby. The title of the new work
was the “<cite>Athenian Gazette; or, Casuistical Mercury, Resolving all
the Nice and Curious Questions Proposed by the Ingenious</cite>.” The
<cite>Gazette</cite> was published twice a week, every Tuesday and Saturday,
each number consisting of a single folio. The first number made
its appearance on Tuesday, March 17, 1691, and the last on
June 14, 1697. Each number was sold at one penny, and thirty
numbers, that is, sixty pages, made what was called a volume; and
which, stitched in marble paper, was sold for half-a-crown. In
the first number that was issued, seven questions are answered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the following order, viz.:—1. Whether the torments of the damned
are visible to the saints in heaven? 2. Whether the soul is eternal,
or pre-existent from the creation, or contemporary with its embryo?
3. Whether every man has a good and bad angel attending him?
4. Where was the soul of Lazarus for the four days he lay in the
grave? 5. Whether all souls are alike? 6. Whether it is lawful
for a man to beat his wife? 7. How came the spots in the moon?</p>

<p class='c001'>In an advertisement, at the end of No. 1, correspondents are
requested to send their questions, “by a penny post letter, to Mr
Smith’s, at his Coffee-house, in Stocks Market, in the Poultry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As already stated, thirty numbers made what was called a
volume; but to each of the first five volumes was attached a supplement,
quite as large as the volume itself, containing “the
transactions and experiments of the foreign virtuosos, and also
their ingenious conferences upon many nice and curious questions;
together with an account of the design and scope of most of the
considerable books printed in all languages, and the quality of the
author, if known.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley and his friends were soon inundated with questions; so
much so, that in the preface to vol. ii., they say they have nearly
four thousand on hand unanswered; they also request that no
obscene questions be sent, for they are resolved not to answer
them; nor riddles, for riddles are of no use to the general public;
nor anything else, the answer to which may be a scandal to the
Government, or an abuse to particular persons.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the publication of the first six volumes, the <cite>Athenian
Gazette</cite> was issued only twice a week; but afterwards the numbers
were published every Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday, until
the completion of the nineteenth volume, when it was announced
that, “as the coffee-houses have the votes every day, and nine
newspapers every week, the Athenian Society propose to drop the
publication of sheets four days a week, and henceforth to publish
the work in volumes quarterly. Thirty numbers, to make volume
xx., would be printed all together; but as soon as the glut of news
was a little over, the weekly numbers would again commence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Eight years after, in 1703, the old Athenian volumes being out
of print, “a collection of all the valuable questions and answers”
was printed in three volumes; and, in 1710, a fourth volume was
added, as a supplement, “being a collection of the remaining questions
and answers in the old <cite>Athenian Gazettes</cite>.” This work had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>a rapid sale, and, in 1704, a second edition was published, with a
dedication to the Earl of Ormond, written by Mr Wesley.</p>

<p class='c001'>The publication of the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite> first occurred to Dunton
whilst he was walking in St George’s Fields. The object of
the work was to receive and to answer questions in all departments
of literature. Finding assistance necessary, Dunton first engaged
the services of Richard Sault, a man who “was admirably well
skilled in the mathematics.” Then the ingenious Dr Norris generously
offered his help <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gratis</i></span>; but refused to become a stated member
of the Athenian Society. The undertaking grew every week,
and hundreds of letters poured in. Dunton writes, “The impatience
of our querists, and the curiosity of their questions, obliged us to
adopt a third member of Athens; and the Rev. Samuel Wesley
being just come to town, all new from the university, and my
acquaintance with him being very intimate, I easily prevailed with
him to embark himself with us. With this new addition, we
found ourselves to be masters of the whole design; and therefore
we neither lessened nor increased our number.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The original “articles of agreement between Samuel Wesley,
clerk, Richard Sault, gent., and John Dunton, for the writing of
the <cite>Athenian Gazette, or Mercury</cite>, dated April 10, 1691,” may
still be seen among Dunton’s MSS. in the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite> was fairly and fully launched, a
rival paper, entitled the <cite>Lacedemonian Mercury</cite>, was published
by Brown &amp; Pate. This was a trifling and even profane performance.
The sole purpose of the writers “seemed to be to laugh
and ridicule solidity and seriousness out of the world.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> This
aroused the ire and energies of Wesley, Sault, and Dunton, and
they succeeded in putting down the rival and ungodly upstart. A
little later, an attack was made upon their publication, by Elkanah
Settle, who brought out a play, entitled “The New Athenian
Comedy; containing the Politicks, Oeconomicks, Tacticks, Crypticks,
Apocalypticks, Stypticks, Scepticks, Pneumaticks, Theologicks,
and Dogmaticks of our most learned Society.” Settle was born at
Dunstable, in 1648, and was educated at Trinity College, Oxford.
He began life by publishing two political pamphlets, which were
publicly burnt, on the accession of James II.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> After this, he turned
Tory, wrote a poem on James’s coronation, and published an essay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>weekly on behalf of James’s administration. He was called the
city poet, because he had a salary for writing a poem annually on
the Lord Mayor’s day. Afterwards he was reduced to such extreme
poverty, that he was not only obliged to write farces for
Bartholomew fair, but to act in them himself. In a farce, called
St George and the Dragon, he acted the dragon, a circumstance
referred to by Dr Young in the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Poor Elkanah, all other changes past,</div>
      <div class='line'>For bread, in Smithfield, dragons hiss’d at last,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spit streams of fire, to make the butchers gape,</div>
      <div class='line'>And found his manners suited to his shape.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Settle died in 1723, the author of ten tragedies, three operas, a
comedy, and a pastoral, all of which are now forgotten. His
comedy was written against Wesley, Sault, and Dunton; but Dunton
says it “was a poor performance, and failed in its design.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The place where Wesley, Sault, and Dunton met respecting the
affairs of their united publication, was Smith’s Coffee-house,
George Yard, adjoining the Mansion House, and here, on one
occasion, an incident occurred, illustrative of Samuel Wesley’s
character. In a box, at the other end of the room, where Wesley
and his two friends were met for business, there were a number
of gentlemen, including an officer of the guards, who, in his conversation,
swore most dreadfully. Wesley heard the oaths of this
foul-mouthed man, and, feeling excessively annoyed at such
disgraceful ribaldry, asked the waiter to bring him a glass of
water, and then, in a loud voice so as to be heard by every
one present, said, “Carry the water to that gentleman in the red
coat, and desire him to wash his mouth after his oaths.” No
sooner were the words spoken, than the irate officer started to his
feet to chastise the bold young parson. His friends, however,
possessed of more sense and manners than himself, seized him
and said, “Nay, Colonel! you gave the first offence, you know
it is an affront to swear in the presence of a clergyman.” And
there for the present the matter ended; but, many years afterwards,
when Wesley was in London attending convocation, on going
through St James’s Park, a gentleman accosted him, and asked if
he knew him. Wesley answered in the negative, upon which the
gentleman recalled to his remembrance the scene in Smith’s coffee-house,
and added, “Since then, sir, I thank God I have feared
an oath, and everything that is offensive to the divine Majesty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>I rejoice at seeing you, and cannot refrain from expressing my
gratitude to God and to you, that we ever met.” A word spoken
in season, how good is it!</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been already stated that Wesley, Sault, and Dunton were
the only proprietors of the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>; but it is right to
add that they had, among their contributors, some of the distinguished
writers of that period.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sault was, in some respects, a remarkable man. His literary
attainments were considerable, and his skill in mathematics great;
but he proved unfaithful to his wife, sunk into a state of extreme
melancholy, and wrote a paper, which, to a great extent, embodied
his own experience, and which he entitled, “The Second Spira,
being a fearful example of an Atheist, who had apostatised from the
Christian religion, and died in despair at Westminster, Dec. 8,
1692.” In this account, he speaks of himself as having spent five
years at the university. He then came to London, and began to
study law. He formed an acquaintance with atheistical companions,
and drank into their spirit. He was then taken ill, and
was visited by his friends. After this, follows an account of his
pretended bewailings of his past faithlessness. Once he knew the
mercies of God and tasted what they were; but now he had denied
Christ, and wished that he was in hell. He refused all sustenance;
he groaned and tossed, and said he knew himself sealed unto damnation.
“Oh that I was to broil,” he cried, “upon that fire for a
thousand years, to purchase the favour of God, and be reconciled
to Him again! But it is a fruitless wish! Millions of millions
of years will bring me no nearer to the end of my tortures than
one poor hour. Oh eternity! eternity!” His last words were,
“Oh the insufferable pangs of hell and damnation.” Sault sent
this fictitious paper to Dunton, in a disguised hand, and requested
him to publish it as a truthful narrative. Dunton did so, and in
six weeks sold thirty thousand copies, at sixpence each. Afterwards,
it became known that the pamphlet was a piece of fiction,
except so far as it was a partial description of Sault’s own experience;
for Dunton tells us that a little before he received the
narrative, “Sault was under the severest terrors of conscience;
and his despair and melancholy made him look like some walking
ghost.” Dunton several times heard him muttering to himself,
“I am damned! I am damned!” The publication of “The Second
Spira” created an immense sensation, and Dunton found it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>necessary to publish the “Secret History of Mr Sault,” so as to
clear himself from the imputation of sham or fraud in giving to
the public such a narrative; and yet, it is a singular circumstance,
that, nearly a hundred years afterwards, John Wesley republished
the greater part of “The Second Spira” in his <cite>Arminian Magazine</cite>,
without a single line of explanation that the piece, though
powerfully written, was almost altogether false. Richard Sault
ultimately removed to Cambridge, where his ingenuity and his
algebraic skill obtained for him a considerable reputation. He
died there in 1704, being supported in his last sickness by the
charity of the scholars. He was interred in St Andrew’s Church,
Cambridge; and a writer, who knew him, says, “his learning
was as universal as his sense of things was fine and curious.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the principal contributors to the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite> were
Daniel Defoe, already sketched, Dr Norris, Nahum Tate, Dean
Swift, Sir William Temple, and Mrs Rowe.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John Norris was born at Collingborne-Kingston, in Wiltshire,
in 1657, and died at Bemerton, in the same county, in 1711. He
was educated first in Winchester School, and afterwards in the
same college, at Oxford, as that which Samuel Wesley entered.
He was elected Fellow of All Souls’ College, and, shortly after
Wesley left Oxford, he was presented to the rectory of Newton St
Loe, and, two years later, to that of Bemerton. He was a pious,
learned, and ingenious man, but had a tincture of <a id='corr136.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='euthusiasm'>enthusiasm</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_136.24'><ins class='correction' title='euthusiasm'>enthusiasm</ins></a></span> in
his nature, which led him to imbibe the principles of the idealists
in philosophy and of the mystics in theology. A late writer says
of him, “In metaphysical acumen, in theological learning, and in
purity of diction, Dr Norris acknowledges no superior. He carries
the whole circle of the sciences in his head, and piety and religion
illustrate all his actions. Never was any question proposed by
ingenious malice or curiosity, but, with the utmost readiness and
facility, he gave not only fair and amusing ideas of it, but full and
most evident demonstrations. He was good, great, and learned;
and a worthy companion of so great a man as Samuel Wesley.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
His greatest work is “The Theory of the Ideal World,” but, besides
that, he published several others.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Nahum Tate was poet-laureate to King William III. He was
born in Dublin in 1655, and educated in the Dublin University.
On coming to London, he fell into pecuniary difficulties, from
which he was relieved by the Earl of Dorset. He was the author
of nine dramatic pieces, and of a variety of miscellaneous poems,
now deservedly forgotten. His name is principally known by his
version of the Psalms, generally affixed to the Liturgy of the
Church of England, and in the composition of which he was assisted
by Dr Brady.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jonathan Swift, another of the Athenian contributors, was a
marvellous mortal. One of his earliest poetical productions was
a commendatory poem of 307 lines sent to the Athenian Society.
Dryden read it, and said, “Cousin Swift, you will never be a
poet.” Dr Johnson says that this unfortunate remark caused
Swift to regard Dryden with malevolence to the end of life. His
“Tale of a Tub,” “Gulliver’s Travels,” and other works are too
well known to need description. He was a man of amazing
genius, but never ought to have been a priest. During his residence
in Dublin University, he incurred no less than seventy
penalties for irregularities; and, in the last year of his residence,
his academical degree was suspended, and he was sentenced to
ask public pardon of the junior dean for insolence. In his personal
habits he was scrupulously nice; and yet there are passages
in his writings almost as gross as his pen could make them. As
an author, he is perhaps not surpassed for originality, and it has
been said of him that he never borrowed a thought from any
man. In some matters he was ludicrously penurious. Once when
going from Sir William Temple’s to his mother’s, he travelled the
whole distance on foot, except when the violence of the weather
drove him into stage waggons; and, at nights, put up at penny
lodgings, where, to secure himself from filth, he hired clean sheets
for sixpence; and yet with all this he can hardly be called a man
of avarice, for he seems to have saved only that he might have
the more to give. Three years before his death, he became insane,
and sunk into a lethargy, in which he remained speechless for a
year. He left the greater part of his fortune to an hospital for
lunatics and idiots. He died in 1744. The pranks and puns of
Jonathan Swift, Dean Of St Patrick’s, are endless. The common
people received him everywhere with profound respect; and upon
one occasion, he made a laughable experiment on the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>belief in his authority. A number of the people having assembled
round the deanery to see an eclipse, Swift became tired of their
commotion, and directed the town crier to make proclamation, that
the eclipse was postponed, by command of the Dean of St Patrick’s,
which had the effect of dispersing the assembled star-gazers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir William Temple was a frequent contributor to the <cite>Athenian
Gazette</cite>. This eminent statesman was a pupil of the learned Dr
Hammond, his maternal uncle. As an author, he was pleasing
and popular, his style being long regarded as a model of grace
and elegance. He died at Moor Park, in 1698, where, in accordance
with his will, his heart was buried in a silver box under the
sun-dial, opposite to a window where he had been accustomed to
contemplate and admire the works of nature; while his body was
privately interred in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last contributor, we mention, was Mrs Rowe, who supplied
“a variety of inimitable poems.” “She was,” says Dunton, “the
richest genius of her sex. She knew the purity of our tongue,
and conversed with as much briskness and gaiety as she wrote.
Her style is noble and flowing, and her images vivid and shining.”
Mrs Rowe, at this time, was not more than twenty years of age;
but she had cultivated music, painting, and poetry from her childhood.
She afterwards studied French and Italian, and enjoyed
the friendship of some of the most eminent literati of her day.
She died in 1737, and, shortly after her death, Dr Isaac Watts
published her “Devout Exercises of the Heart.” A year or
two afterwards, appeared her miscellaneous works, in prose and
verse, in two volumes octavo.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were the principal writers who assisted Samuel Wesley,
Richard Sault, and John Dunton in the publication of their
<cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>. The history of the Athenian Society was
afterwards written by Charles Gildon, and published in a folio of
thirty-six pages. Gildon was a native of the same county as
Samuel Wesley, and about the same age. He was educated at
Douay for a popish priest, but, not liking the priestly office, he
plunged into dissipation, and added to his financial embarrassments
by an imprudent marriage at the age of twenty-three.
Necessity obliged him to turn author, and he produced a variety
of works in prose and verse. He died in 1723. Pope gave him
a place in his “Dunciad;” but Dunton says he was well “acquainted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>with the languages, and wrote with a peculiar briskness which
the common hacks could not boast of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Gildon tells us that the whole design of the Athenian Society
was “not only to improve knowledge in divinity and philosophy,
in all their parts, as well as philosophy in all its latitude, but also
to commend this improvement to the public in the best method
that can be found out for instruction. In their Gazettes may be
found the marrow of what great authors have writ on curious
subjects. The society have set learning in so fair a light, that,
won with its beauty, every one must with eagerness embrace it.
All the knotty points of philosophy, divinity, mathematics, &amp;c.,
are formed into queries by the inquisitive, and answered by the
society, who are not only men of parts, but also industrious to
the highest degree. They are men of sense, and piety, and
patience. Horace never had half the fatigue with the poetaster,
as they must have had with both male and female impertinencies.
One correspondent wishes to know whether any two men have
the same number of hairs on their heads; another wishes to
know whether it be lawful to eat black puddings; and another
whether the devil takes a human form in foreign countries.
There are hundreds of such questions asked and answered. Indeed
queries came in so fast, that in the third number of the
<cite>Gazette</cite> the public were requested to send no more till those
already sent had received replies.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Gildon then proceeds to give an account of the principal contributors.
Of Samuel Wesley he says, “He was a man of profound
knowledge, not only of the Holy Scriptures, of the councils, and
of the fathers, but also of every other <em>Art</em> that comes within the
number of the <em>liberal</em>. His zeal and ability in giving spiritual
directions were great. With invincible power he confirmed the
wavering, and confuted heretics. Beneath the genial warmth of
his wit, the most barren subject became fertile and divertive.
His style was sweet and manly, soft without satiety, and learned
without pedantry. His temper and conversation were affable. His
compassion for the sufferings of his fellow-creatures, was as great
as his learning and his parts. Were it possible for any man to
act the part of a universal priest, he would certainly deem it his
duty to take care of the spiritual good of all mankind. In all
his writings and actions, he evinced a deep concern for all that
bear the glorious image of their Maker; and was so apostolical in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>his spirit, that pains, labours, watchings, and prayers were far
more delightful to him than honours to the ambitious, wealth to
the miser, or pleasures to the voluptuous.” Such, in substance, is
Gildon’s character of Wesley. He adds, “It were to be wished
that a great many of the clergy would have him in view, as a sure
direction of their behaviour, since an imitation of his practical
virtues would confute the profane enemies of that sacred body,
by the most prevalent of arguments, <em>example</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Gildon was doubtless well acquainted with Wesley; and hence
such a testimony is too important to be omitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible, in a work like this, to give a full idea of the
vast and varied learning embodied in these old <cite>Athenian Gazettes</cite>.
Error is confuted, and superstitions and follies ridiculed. Many
of the most perplexing questions in divinity are discussed with
great ability. Philosophy is handled with equal excellence. All
sorts of questions relating to metaphysics, astronomy, mathematics,
law, anatomy, and, even love and courtship, are answered with
consummate care. It cannot be denied, that the work contains
things which would now be deemed gross and indelicate; but
some allowance must be made, on the ground that the literary
tastes of the people were, at that time, widely different from what
they are at present; and, it must also be observed further, that, in
the articles bearing upon divinity, history, poetry, and natural
philosophy, (upon all of which subjects Samuel Wesley may be
presumed to have written,) there is not a line offensive to good
taste, though, of course, opinions are expressed which may fairly
be disputed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Adam Clarke writes, respecting the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>,
“No reader can peruse them, (the volumes,) without profit; for
although the authors submitted to answer questions of little or no
importance, yet the work at large contains many things of great
value. When I was little more than a child, an odd volume of
the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, lent me by a friend, was a source of improvement
and delight; and now I consult this work with double
interest, knowing the well-nerved hand, by which at least one-third
of it was composed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We cannot state, with certainty, what articles in the <cite>Athenian
Gazettes</cite> were written by Samuel Wesley; but, as he was the only
clergyman in the Athenian Society, it may fairly be presumed
that he answered all, or nearly all, the questions relating to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>divinity and to church history. He was also a poet, and there
cannot be a doubt that many of the poetical pieces were likewise
the productions of his genius.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the indices of the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, there is a list of about
2800 questions, and of these about 900 refer to theology and
the history of the Church; so that it is not unreasonable to suppose,
that one-third of the Athenian questions were answered by
Mr Wesley. The following is a selection, and will tend to show
the difficulties with which he courageously grappled:—</p>

<p class='c001'>These are about a tenth part of the biblical and theological
questions answered by Samuel Wesley in the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>,
and are given here for a twofold purpose; first, to suggest to
youthful readers topics to think about; and secondly, to show
the difficulties courageously encountered by Samuel Wesley, and
the curious and daring character of his studies.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>It would not be difficult to gather from the answers to the nine
hundred biblical and theological questions in the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>,
the principal points of Mr Wesley’s creed. The longest theological
articles are those levelled against the Baptists and the Quakers.
One piece alone, written against the former, fills nearly fifty pages
of the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>; and against the latter there are several
articles, showing that the Lincolnshire rector was no ardent admirer
of the broad-brimmed followers of George Fox. They are
charged with intolerance, enthusiasm, silliness, and with holding
dangerous opinions and detestable doctrines. A Quaker, in fact,
was a mischievous and troublesome compendium of all sorts of
heresies. Samuel Wesley, as a rule, was generous and liberal in
his sentiments respecting others; but some sects and parties, at
the close of the seventeenth century, were so fanatical, bigoted,
bitter, and offensive, that he found it difficult to regard them with
the same fraternal feelings with which he regarded Christian
brotherhoods in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>With one or two exceptions, the theological and religious views
of Samuel Wesley were as Scriptural and as sound as the standard
of Methodist teaching contained in the well-known Sermons and
Notes of his son John. There may be a difference of phraseology
between the father and son, but their doctrines are <em>substantially</em>
the same. Our space forbids lengthened quotations; but perhaps
the following extracts from the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite> will not be unacceptable,
as containing statements of Scripture doctrines, and as
tending to exhibit the opinions of Mr Wesley on some of the most
important verities of the Christian religion, and on some of the
most interesting points of ecclesiastical polity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley was a firm believer in the authenticity of the
Holy Scriptures. He contends that the Bible now used “is the
same that was written by the apostles and prophets,” and that,
because they were “inspired by the Spirit of God,” the Bible “is
the very Word of God.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He also had an unshaken faith in the doctrine of the Holy
Trinity. He argues that it “is impossible for a man to invent
fuller or clearer expressions for the proof of anything in question
than the evangelist St John” employs in favour of the doctrine of
Christ’s divinity. After adducing evidence of this, he concludes,
with an air of conscious triumph, “When I see all this answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>without straining it into perfect incongruous nonsense, I
promise to turn Socinian.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> “The Arians,” says he,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> in another
place, “in some of their confessions of faith, did grant
that the Son was from all eternity, by such an emanation from
the Father as that whereby the light proceeds from the sun;
but yet contended for a moment’s difference between their existence—the
Son receiving His, as they think, from the Father;
whereby they unavoidably fell into the same absurdity which
other pretenders to reason have since done—that, I mean, of a
<em>made</em> God, or a <em>subordinate</em> Supreme.” Language like this
is unmistakable. Samuel Wesley was no dubious hesitator between
two opinions. While yet a youth in Mr Morton’s academy,
he had been disgusted with the Socinian, Biddle; and, a few years
later, he was the means of extricating one of the finest of intellects
from Socinian meshes; for his own wife, Susanna Wesley, who,
while a girl in her father’s house, had reasoned herself into the
Socinian creed, acknowledges it as one of the great mercies of her
life, that, she was “married to a religious orthodox man, and by
him was first drawn off from the Socinian heresy.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='note144'></a>Samuel Wesley, like his son John, was a moderate Arminian.
He fearlessly repudiates the doctrines of election and reprobation.
“We cannot,” says he, “be satisfied by any of those scriptures
which are brought for that purpose, that there is any such <em>election</em>
of a <em>determinate number</em> as either puts a force on their <em>natures</em>,
and <em>irresistably</em> saves them, or absolutely excludes all the rest of
mankind from salvation. We think there is no one place in the
Holy Scriptures which proves that so many men, and no more,
were <em>irresistably determined</em> to everlasting salvation.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> He believed
that “God predestinated those to salvation whom He foresaw
would make a good use of His grace, resolving to damn only
such as He foresaw would continue impenitent.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> He maintains
that “God made man upright, and a free agent, and that God’s
prescience presides over man’s free agency, but doth not overrule it,
by saving man whether He will or no, or by damning him <a id='corr144.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='undeservedly.'>undeservedly.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_144.34'><ins class='correction' title='undeservedly.'>undeservedly.”</ins></a></span><a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
“God necessitates no evil action, yet He foresees all.
If God tempts no man to evil, much less does He necessitate.
Indeed, were He to do this, the nature of man would be destroyed,
the proposal of rewards and punishments would be ironical, preaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>would be vain, and faith also vain. If you ask us to reconcile
all the differences <a id='corr145.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“arising'>arising</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_145.2'><ins class='correction' title='“arising'>arising</ins></a></span> out of the doctrines of God’s prescience
and man’s free agency, we promise to do it when philosophers can
solve the incommensurability of matter, and twenty other phenomena,
and make them agree with demonstrations which appear
diametrically opposite unto them. In the meantime, let us think
soberly and modestly, as becomes us in these matters. Let every
one enjoy his own sense, so he makes not God the author of sin,
and let us all cry out, ‘How unsearchable are His judgments, and
His ways past finding out.’”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley believed in the doctrine of universal redemption;
in other words, that Jesus Christ “atoned so far for the sins of
all mankind as to make them in a salvable condition, or to repair
the ruins which were made by the first Adam, which is plain from
Rom. v. 12, 18, &amp;c.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> “God really wills the salvation of all
men, as far as is consistent with the liberty of man and His own
purity and justice;” and He “has also used all the necessary
means for our salvation;” “He offers pardon of all sin, and right
to life in Christ, to all men without exception, on condition of
believing and acceptance.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He further believed that no man can do an “action properly
and perfectly acceptable to God by his own natural abilities, abstracted
from the assistance of God’s Spirit, but by His common
assistance he may pray, abstain from sin, and practise duty; and,
if he continues in these good actions, he will have still more aid,
and go on to perfection.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the doctrines of justification and justifying faith,
Mr Wesley writes: “Forgiveness of sins is, at least, included in
justification, nay, is the main part, if not the whole thereof. It
may, without violence, be reckoned a convertible term with it.
Our sins being pardoned, our being esteemed righteous by God,
our justification through our Saviour’s merits, we think are but
the same thing in different expressions.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> “By God’s justifying
a sinner, is meant His looking upon us and treating us as just
and innocent persons, although before we stood guilty of heinous
sins, and thereupon liable to grievous punishments.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> <a id='corr145.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='We'>“We</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_145.36'><ins class='correction' title='We'>“We</ins></a></span> are
saved by the merits of Christ Jesus; for His sake, not our own;
and this we look upon to be the same, in other words, as Christ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>imputed righteousness.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> “We are justified, or accepted with
God, as a means, by faith, or a true belief of what God reveals, and
by trusting in His mercy, through His Son.”<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> “But then this very
faith must be justified by works, as Abraham’s was, for it would
have been in vain for him to have pretended he had believed God’s
promise to him, had he not, in obedience to His command, also
offered up his son Isaac.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> That faith, without which there is no
salvation, “is a steady belief of all that God reveals, especially in the
gospel, particularly that Jesus is the Messiah, or Saviour of the
<em>world</em>, and that He will save <em>me</em>, if I <em>depend</em> on Him, and <em>obey</em>
His commands.”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a> No follower of John Wesley holds the doctrine
of justification by faith more clearly, or more firmly, than did
John Wesley’s noble-minded father.</p>

<p class='c001'>The new birth, writes the clear-headed and thoroughly orthodox
young clergyman, “is that particular aid of God’s Holy Spirit,
which works an entire change in the mind, and turns men from
evil to good, being a new principle of action in them.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is a remarkable fact, not generally known, that Samuel
Wesley was a Millenarian. The Rev. William Lindsay Alexander,
in an elaborate article in the “Encyclopædia Britannica” gives
the following as the chief tenets of the Millenarian creed:—“That
Jerusalem is to be rebuilt, the temple to be restored, and sacrifice
again offered on the altar; that this city is to form the residence
of Christ, who is to reign there in glory with all His saints for a
thousand years; that, for this purpose, there shall be a resurrection
of all the pious dead, that none of the Saviour’s followers
may be absent during His triumph; that, at the close of the thousand
years, they shall all return to heaven, and the world be left
to Satan and his followers for a season; and that then the general
resurrection and last judgment shall take place, and the
history of the world be brought to a close.” In vol. iv. of the
<cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, the No. for October 17, 1691, is entirely occupied
by a Millenarian article, which had been specially advertised
on the Tuesday previous, and the following extract will
show substantially the opinions held by Samuel Wesley:—“We
believe, as all Christians of the purest ages did, that the saints
shall reign with Christ on earth a thousand years; that this reign
shall be immediately before the general resurrection, and after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>calling of the Jews, the fulness of the Gentiles, and the destruction
of Antichrist, whom our Saviour shall destroy by the <em>brightness
of His coming</em>, and <em>appearance in heaven</em>; that at the beginning
of this thousand years shall be the first resurrection,
wherein martyrs and holy men shall rise and reign here in spiritual
delights in the New Jerusalem, in a new heaven and new
earth, foretold by the holy prophets.” After this statement of his
belief follows an able article on the same subject, but it is scarce
within the province which we have prescribed for ourselves, to
attempt either to refute or to establish the truth of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following is a somewhat startling opinion respecting the
future state of the righteous and wicked:—“They shall both arise
equally immortal, and diversified in nothing but their last sentence.
We shall then see not by receiving the visible species into the narrow
glass of an organised eye; we shall then hear without the
distinct and curious contexture of the ear. The body then shall
be all eye, all ear, all sense in the whole, and every sense in every
part. In a word, it shall be all over a common sensorium; and
being made of the purest æther, without the mixture of any lower
or grosser element, the soul shall, by one undivided act, at once
perceive all that variety of objects which now cannot, without
several distinct organs, and successive actions or passions, reach
our sense. Every sense shall be perfect; the ear shall hear everything
at once throughout the spacious limits both of heaven and
hell, with a perfect distinction, and without confounding that
<em>anthem</em> with this <em>blasphemy</em>; the eye shall find no matter or substance
to fix it; and so of the other senses. The reason of this is
plain and convincing; for, if the bodies of the just and unjust
were not thus qualified, they could not be proper subjects for the
exercise of an eternity, but would consume and be liable to a dissolution,
or to new changes. Hence we assert, that every <em>individual
person in heaven and hell</em> shall hear and see all that passes in
either state; these to a more extensive aggravation of their tortures,
by the loss of what the other enjoy; and those to a greater
increase of their bliss, in escaping what the others suffer.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such are some of the chief theological views that were entertained
by Samuel Wesley. Others might be added, but space
forbids. He has been almost invariably represented as holding
the principles of the High Church party; but nothing can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>more unfounded than this. He preferred the Church of England
to any other Church, and thought its doctrines, rituals, and devotions
the best in existence. But where is the Methodist, or the
Independent, or the Baptist, but what thinks and feels exactly
the same respecting the ecclesiastical system to which he adheres?
The man that does not prefer his own Church to any other Church
is a man without principle; yea, a man whose principle is bad;
for, in matters of supreme importance, he is adhering to a system
of ecclesiastical doctrine and discipline, not because he thinks it
the best, but to serve some other purpose—mercenary, mean, and
miserable. Samuel Wesley thought the Church of England the
best; but he was not the narrow-minded and little-hearted bigot to
unchurch other churches, and deny that so far from being equally
good, they were not good at all. Hear what he says on both
subjects:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The <em>doctrine</em> of the Church of England we entirely embrace,
otherwise we could not be Christians. We are ready to subscribe
to her Articles, taking all of them, as we are verily persuaded, in
the same sense which the compilers intended. For her <em>discipline</em>,
we believe the <em>essentials</em> of it—<em>Liturgy</em> and <em>Episcopacy</em>—are
agreeable to the primitive pattern and the Word of God. For
her <em>rituals</em> and <em>devotions</em>—we are sure they are the most perfect
and pure that any Church in the world now enjoys, and
dare almost add, or ever did. There are not two <em>passages</em> in
them, which we would desire to have changed; though, should
the authority and wisdom of Church and State think fit to
make any alterations as to words and smaller circumstances,
for the sake of peace and union, we should think it our duty,
modestly and gladly to submit.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Wesley’s opinion of the
clergy may be gathered from the following:—“It is not strange
that, among so considerable a body of men, there should be
found some who extremely disgrace their character, and are
highly unworthy; but it is notorious, that all possible care is
now taken that the clergy should lead such lives as they are
obliged to by solemn vow and promise; and it is known that
those who do not, are not so soon preferred as perhaps they might
have been in former reigns. With some exceptions, the clergy
of England are at this time as considerable a body, both for
piety and learning, good preaching and good living, as any in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the world, or perhaps, as any that have lived here in any age
of the Church since the apostles. Of all those country parishes
with which we are acquainted, we cannot, in fifty or threescore
parishes, think of above three or four, who disgrace their character.
So far from it, the pulpits are filled with sober and ingenious
men, good preachers, and good livers.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>So much in reference to his opinion of the Church and its
ministers. We add two quotations about dissent:—“A Christian
Church becomes not more or less Christian by being national;
but if a National Church agrees in doctrine with the doctrine of
Christ, and Dissenters agree in doctrine with the National Church,
neither of them are schismatics from the Church of Christ.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> And
again: “There is no real difference betwixt the Church of England
and the Presbyterians as to the manner of worship and preaching.
They are really one as to fundamentals; and any one so persuaded,
may with a safe conscience communicate with either. Let those
that keep up the partition wall, take heed lest they are thereby
excluded out of the bond of charity, which makes all of one mind,
and partakers of the same privileges.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This is scarce the language of a High Churchman, consigning
Dissenters to the uncovenanted mercies of Almighty God. Samuel
Wesley was of a temperament too painstaking, too ardent, and
too sincere, to be a latitudinarian; but, at the same time, he was
too good and too great a man to be a bigot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before leaving the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, it may be added that its
writers acted in great harmony, and nothing was published by
any one which had not the approval of all. They held meetings
regularly at stated times, chose a moderator, and determined controversial
points by a majority of votes. If any member happened
to be absent, he had to send, except in some particular
cases, his papers for the approbation of his friends.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> The project
was a great success. It rose superior to all the opposition of
its opponents, Anabaptists, Quakers, Usurers, and Lacedemonians;
and gained from the nation increasing, and almost general applause.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br />MORE LITERARY WORK—1692–1693.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The publication of the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite> was begun March 17,
1691, and was closed June 14, 1697. In itself, it was a formidable
undertaking. The questions sent to the writers were so many,
so diversified, so curious, and so difficult, that to answer them
required immense reading and research. And yet, in the midst
of the publication of this work, the Athenian Society courageously
began another, even more extensive and more arduous;
the proposals for printing which were issued, in the preface to
the third volume of the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, October 17, 1691.
The work was to consist of 120 sheets; it was to contain nothing
but what had the approbation of the <em>whole</em> Athenian Society;
and the price per copy, unbound, was to be ten shillings. To
some extent, it was similar in plan to the supplements attached
to the first volumes of the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>; and probably this
was the reason why the supplements were dropped a few months
before the new work was issued. At length, on the 6th of June
1692, which was shortly after Samuel Wesley’s removal to South
Ormsby, the work was published in a folio volume of more than
five hundred pages, and was entitled, “The Young Student’s
Library: containing Extracts and Abridgments of the most valuable
Books, printed in England and in the Foreign Journals, from
the Year Sixty-five to this time;”—to which is added, “A new
Essay upon all sorts of Learning; wherein the Use of the Sciences
is distinctly treated on, by the Athenian Society. London: Printed
for John Dunton, 1692.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Prefixed to this volume is a curious and fantastic frontispiece,
strikingly characteristic of Dunton’s genius. At the four corners
are representations of Athens, Rome, Oxford, and Cambridge.
At a long table are seated the members of the Athenian Society,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>twelve in number, Dunton evidently in the middle, and Samuel
Wesley, the only clergyman, at his side. Before the table are all
sorts of characters presenting their enigmas for solution. One is
a faithless lady in a mask, come to inquire how she may convert
her faithless husband to a sense of propriety. Another, as a
fashionable coquette, with a spaniel in her lap, presents to the
learned Athenians her square-sized billet, and awaits with self-complacent
impudence an answer. A moon-struck lawyer and an
honest Jack Tar eagerly ask for counsel; while a disciple of Euclid,
compasses in hand, and studying a globe, longs for a mathematical
solution. A poor parson inquires how he is to get a
living; and a whole rout of fishwives, thieves, and bad characters
clamour for advice; while, before a tripod, filled with burning
chestnuts, is a monkey, with a cat in his paws, making her pick
out the nuts on his behalf, and thereby showing the cautiousness
of the Athenians in answering questions likely to burn their own
fingers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Young Student’s Library” contains the substance of
above one hundred volumes, many of them folio in size. The
extracting and condensing of the contents of such a mass of
books must have been a work of enormous labour. Very able
synopses are given of above eighty different works.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> And, in
addition to these reviews, there are two most elaborate articles
written by Samuel Wesley—one, entitled “An Essay upon all
sorts of Learning,” and the other, “A Discourse concerning the
Antiquity, Divine Original, and Authority of the Points, Vowels,
and Accents that are placed to the Hebrew Bible;” and, in close
connexion with the latter, are six Critical Disquisitions upon the
various editions of the Scriptures, the Polyglot Bible, Hebrew
Grammars, Hebrew Lexicons, and Hebrew Poetry, all of which
are probably the productions of Mr Wesley’s pen.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the foregoing summary, it will be seen that “The Young
Student’s Library” is a remarkable book, evincing an enormous
extent of reading and research, and displaying an amount of labour
almost incredible. Many of the volumes analysed are quarto and
folio in size, and not a few are written in foreign languages. It
is impossible to determine how many of these literary condensations
were made by Mr Wesley; but there can be no doubt that
he was one of the principal contributors to the work, inasmuch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>as, from the first, he had been one of the chief members, if not
<em>the chief</em> member, of the Athenian Society; and this opinion is
strengthened by the fact, that his “Essay on Learning” is placed
as a sort of preliminary discourse at the very commencement of
the book; while his article on the “Hebrew Points” occupies an
equally prominent position in what may be considered the second
section of the volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>The work was announced as “containing the substance and
pith of all that is valuable in most of the best books printed in
England and in the foreign journals;” whilst its object was “to
provide means for improving the knowledge of those who had
not the ability of purse to arrive at a learned education, and to
purchase all those voluminous books which treat of those several
arts and sciences which are required to the composing a scholar.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
The preface of the book modestly, and not untruthfully, observes:
“These treatises are not only pleasant as to their variety, but
useful for their brevity; there being the substance and value of a
considerable part of a good library brought within the compass
of this volume; which as it will spare much labour—a man being
able to peruse here more of an author in half an hour, than in
half a day in the author himself—so it will save a great deal of
expense to such as would be master of the knowledge of many
books, the performances of the authors being here epitomised.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been already stated that, in this remarkable book, there
are, besides epitomes of the works of others, two elaborate articles,
the productions of Samuel Wesley’s scholarship and pen; and
these are of such interest and importance as to justify further
remarks respecting them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Discourse concerning the Antiquity, Divine Original, and
Authority of the Points, Vowels, and Accents that are placed to
the Hebrew Bible,” if printed separately, would make an 8vo
volume of nearly 250 pages. In the introduction, young students
in divinity are strongly urged to make themselves thoroughly
acquainted with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament;
and, in order to this, they are earnestly advised to master the
works of the Jewish Rabbins, because the Rabbins will help to a
right understanding of many difficult Hebrew words and phrases,
and will explain many rites and ceremonies, ordinances, and
customs, which are but slightly mentioned in the sacred Scriptures.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>From them will be obtained the best explanation of proverbial
speeches, and of the names of places, sects, moneys, weights,
and measures; and also of the moral, judicial, and ceremonial
laws of Moses. A knowledge of the Rabbinical writings is also
necessary to maintain and defend the purity, the points, vowels,
and accents of the sacred text itself. After this, books are recommended
as helpful in attaining an acquaintance with the Hebrew
Bible—viz., Robertson’s “First and Second Gate to the Holy
Tongue;” Jessey’s “Lexicon;” Buxtorf’s “Epitome, Thesaurus, and
Lexicon,” Bythner’s “Lyra Prophetica;” Leusden’s “Compendium;”
and Arius Montanus’s “Interlineary Bible.” Wesley also
recommends the study of the Mishna, the Talmud, and the Rabbinical
Commentaries of Aben Ezra, and others. He likewise
expresses a willingness to give to the public an English translation
of these Rabbinical writings, if his bookseller received sufficient
encouragement to publish; and, in another place, he says:
“If this discourse about the original of the points, vowels, and
accents, finds acceptance and encouragement, I intend a distinct
discourse upon the sacred original text of the Old Testament, in
defence of its purity and perfection, as it is now enjoyed by the
Protestant Church; wherein I purpose to handle all those curiosities
that are the subject of critical observation about the same;
being very willing to defend our religion, and the rule of our faith,
to the uttermost of my power.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He then shows the vast importance of the points of the Hebrew
Bible; contending that he who reads without the points is like
one who rides a horse without a bridle, and knows not whither
he goes. He also contends that his book is required and opportune,
on account of such men as Capellus and Dr Walton having
recently published the dangerous doctrine that the Hebrew points
were not divine in their origin, but were added to the sacred text
by the Masorites of Tiberias, about five hundred years before the
birth of Christ. After this, he most elaborately refutes the
opinions respecting the human and novel origin of the points,
alleging that, with one exception, there is not a single Jewish
writer, who makes the least mention of the Hebrew punctuation
being invented by the Masorites, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 500. He contends that the
time and the place, when and where the points are said to have
been invented, are exceedingly improbable; and that the Masorites,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to whom they are attributed, were unequal to the task, they
being a set of magical and monstrous sots—a company of blind
and crafty fools, bewitching and bewitched with traditions.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second part of his work, on the Hebrew points, Samuel
Wesley proceeds to prove that the points are at least as old as
Ezra, that they are of divine original, and therefore of divine
authority. In confirmation of this, he appeals to the testimonies
of Jews and Christians, and answers all sorts of objections.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is almost impossible to give any adequate outline of this
most learned production. Perhaps it is not too much to say, that
there is no book of modern times in which so much learning is
condensed into so small a space. It shows, incontestably, that
Samuel Wesley was a most able Hebrew scholar, and, though at
this time only thirty years of age, had gone through a course of
learned reading to which but few scholars of the present age will
apply themselves. Gildon, in his “History of the Athenian Society,”
remarks that Wesley “has taken notice of all which can be
raised against the opinion he defends;” that he had “given himself
for many years to the study of the Hebrew and original
tongues, and to Rabbinical learning in general;” and that his
“performance was quite equal to the nobleness of the subject.”
“He has executed his task,” continues Gildon, “with a great
deal of strength of judgment, force of argument, and profoundness
of skill. It was the saying of a great man, that he would
easily tell the progress any one would make in science if he
knew but the value he had for it; and no man could have a
greater esteem for any knowledge than this divine (Wesley) had
for this.” He considered it “the chief and obligatory study of
men of his character, who were to give the true and genuine sense
of Scripture to the souls they directed, under the pain of woe at
the last tribunal. His treatise is accurate and elaborate, and
abundantly satisfactory; and it were to be wished that the same
great man would oblige the world with those other pieces of
Rabbinical learning which he mentions in these sheets. No
prospect of any present or future advantage to himself induced
him to engage in this laborious work, he having generously given
the copy to the publisher without the least gratuity. In him
learning has met with a happy temper, an innate modesty, and a
sweet agreeable affability to all men; a charity not stinted to factions,
parties, or religions; but universal, like that of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>institutor of our holy religion. In short, the virtues that this
reverend divine has made a part of himself are much more noble
qualifications than that extraordinary one of his learning.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Such
a testimony, from a man contemporaneous with Samuel Wesley, is
worth recording.</p>

<p class='c001'>We only add respecting the “Discourse on the Hebrew Points,”
that, in the preface to the “Young Student’s Library,” it is stated
“that the author of the Hebrew punctuation has retired into the
country,” (to South Ormsby,) “where his necessary business will
take up a great part of his time; yet whatever letters and objections
shall be sent to him about his performance he will, notwithstanding
his business, set apart so much time as to maintain what
he has advanced, and to answer all objections whatever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Brave Samuel Wesley! None but an empty-headed braggart,
or a great-minded man, conscious of his strength, would have
dared to give a challenge such as this.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second piece written by Mr Wesley, and published in the
“Young Student’s Library,” is entitled “An Essay upon all Sorts
of Learning.” A few extracts will tend to show his intense passion
for intellectual pursuits, and the wide range of his literary
studies.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Learning.</em>—“Learning is of universal extension. Like the
sun, it denies not its rays to any that will open their eyes. Other
treasures may be monopolised, but this is increased by diffusion,
and the more a man imparts the more he retains. Rather than a
wise man would be deprived of learning, he would even steal it
from the minutes of necessary rest or recreation.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>The Bible.</em>—“If we examine nature, and anatomise the law
written upon our hearts,—if we peruse the volumes of the ancient
philosophers, or those of the Brahmins and Chinese,—if we make a
strict inquiry into all their rules and lessons of morality,—we have
a compendium of all in the sacred writ. For abstruseness of
notions, the first of Genesis outvies the Egyptian philosophy; and
for elegancy of style, the prophecy of Isaiah and the Epistle to the
Hebrews far exceed the eloquent orations of Cicero and Demosthenes.
In short, there is nothing here, either promised or
threatened, commanded or forbidden, but what is godlike, and
worthy its divine original. Our deists have nothing to object
but a little buffoonery, and it would be a pity to deny them the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>happiness they take in that, or any other short-lived pleasure
necessarily arising from their principles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After a brief but pithy and powerful defence of revealed religion,
he recommends to the biblical student a list of both English
and Latin books that will greatly assist him in his studies, including
the works of Poole, Hammond, Grotius, Eusebius, Hooker,
Burnet, Stillingfleet, Lightfoot, Sherlock, Usher, Barrow, Du Pin,
Hales, Jeremy Taylor, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>His next article is upon history, of which he writes:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“<em>History</em> gives the best prospect into human affairs, and makes
us familiar with the remotest regions. By this, we may ascertain
what practices have established kingdoms, and what has contributed
to the weakness and overthrow of bodies politic. We may
see all Asia, Africa, and America in England. We may encompass
the world with Drake, and make new discoveries with Columbus;
we may visit the Grand Signior in the Seraglio, converse
with Seneca, and consult with Cæsar. In a word, whatever
humanity has done that is noble, great, and surprising, either by
action or suffering, may by us be done over again in theory, and,
if we have souls capable of transcribing the bravest copies, we may
meet instances worth our emulation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After the essays upon divinity and history there are others upon
philosophy, law, physic, surgery, mathematics, and arithmetic, all
of them brief, but very able; and, in connexion with each, a list of
books which Samuel Wesley recommends to be read and studied.
In these lists, Wesley displays his taste for the best literature then
published, and also the immense extent of his own reading and
research.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his essay on <em>Poetry</em>, he says, “Poetry was the first philosophy
the world was blest with, and had that influence on the
minds of men, then fallen from their primitive reason into the
wildest barbarity, that it soon brought them to civility, and to
know the dictates of reason from those of fancy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then advises “candidates for the laurel” to “consider the
difficulty of being a good poet.” “Mediocrity is intolerable in
poetry, however excusable in other affairs.” “A young poet
should never be ambitious of writing much, for a little gold is
worth a great heap of lead.” “To be a perfect poet, a man must
be a general scholar, skilled both in the tongues and sciences,
and must be perfect in history and moral philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Such was Samuel Wesley’s estimate of the qualifications of a
perfect poet. Perhaps it would have been better if he himself had
observed some of his own rules more strictly than what he did.
Dunton says: “Mr Wesley had an early inclination to poetry, but
he usually wrote too fast to write well. Two hundred couplets a
day are too many by two-thirds to be well furnished with all the
beauties and graces of that art.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Mr Wesley’s article on “Dialling,” there is the following
beautiful sentence: “Time is the greatest treasure in this world
that a mortal can be intrusted with. We are not only probationers
for eternity by the help of time, but even the little interests
of this world are managed by the means of it. To divide time by
dials, clocks, and watches, is a faint imitation of God Almighty,
who has divided the year into spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
and even our life into days and nights.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of <em>Geometry</em> he writes: “All our most necessary as well as
most noble arts and sciences depend on it. None of the mechanical
arts can ever be brought to perfection without it; and if
painters were ignorant of proportion, angles, circles, and squares,
all their works would want beauty, and themselves would want
satisfaction. A joiner cannot so much as cut a round table unless
he understands a circle; nor a carpenter square a piece of timber
unless he know, by the rule of square figures, when his work is
finished. The watch and clock makers would be at a loss, if it
were not for this science; and no builder could regularly design a
fabric without a knowledge of geometrical problems. Navigation
and gunnery can never be understood without geometry; and to
these I may add, fortification, dialling, music, astronomy, and
surveying. It would be needless to say any more of the advantages
of geometry, here being enough to fire the mind of any ingenious
student to a diligent inquiry into it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Writing on <em>Optics</em>, he says: “’Tis pleasant to undeceive the
eye in the common accidents of life, and to see it approach, in
some measure, towards that certainty of judging and apprehending
<em>visibles</em> that it will attain to at the day of resurrection, when it
will be above the power of being cheated by concave or convex, or
deluded by a refraction or reflection. This may, in a great measure,
be accomplished in this world by such as give themselves up
to the study of optics.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>There are other articles on painting, astronomy, and navigation,
and glances at geography, music, architecture, grammar, and
rhetoric. The general “Essay on all Sorts of Learning” concludes
thus: “Whoever makes a trial of the worth of learning will find
that all encomiums come far short of the thing itself; and that
those only can best reflect upon its value who are sensible of the
enjoyment of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, then, is a general outline of the contents of “The Young
Student’s Library,” published in 1692; but no one can form an
adequate idea of the work without seeing it. None but immense
readers and careful writers like Samuel Wesley and his Athenian
friends could have put such a book together.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the intention of the Athenian Society to have followed
up the publication of the “Young Student’s Library” with another
work—“A New System of Experimental Philosophy upon the
Four Elements”—and embracing a description of strange appearances,
noises, strange winds, subterranean steams, waters, their
properties and inhabitants, earths of all sorts, plants and trees,
husbandry, animals, insects, birds, reptiles, fishes, extraordinary
buildings and extraordinary persons, antiquities, &amp;c.;<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a> but I am
not aware that this was ever issued.</p>

<p class='c001'>Contemporaneously with the publication of the “Young Student’s
Library,” Mr Wesley was employed upon another work,
which has never yet been noticed by any Wesleyan biographer.
In vol. vi. of the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, it is announced that the
Athenian Society have bought the right to a “Monthly Journal
of Books,” and that this journal will now be carried on by a
“London Divine,” under the title of “The Complete Library; or,
News for the Ingenious;” and that it will be issued monthly, beginning
with the month of May 1692.</p>

<p class='c001'>The work was published accordingly. We have seen and examined
three of the volumes, containing between four and five
hundred pages each, and extending from May 1692 to March
1694. The numbers are divided into three sections: 1. Original
pieces; 2. An account of the choicest books printed in England
and on the Continent of Europe; 3. Notes on current events.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first article is entitled, “A Discourse concerning the Integrity
and Purity of the Hebrew Bible; by the Author of a Discourse
concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Points, Vowels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and Accents,”—thus plainly intimating that the “London Divine,”
who had the management of the work, was none other than Samuel
Wesley. Besides, no one acquainted with Mr Wesley’s mode of
thinking and style of writing, can have any hesitation in pronouncing
him the author.</p>

<p class='c001'>He maintains that all religion stands or falls as we can defend
and prove the integrity of the Hebrew copy of the Bible; and his
principal object is to refute the opinions of Capellus, the leader of
all those who say the Hebrew Bible has been corrupted. The
article is learned and able, and fills twenty-four small quarto pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>In succeeding numbers there are kindred articles, evidently by
the same practised pen. One is on “Scripture Chronology;” another
is, “A Critical Inquiry into the Number, Names, Division,
and Order of the Books of the Old Testament;” another is, “The
Ancient Manner of Reading, Writing, and Preserving the Law of
Moses, as an evidence of the unparalleled care taken in former
times to preserve the Bible in its purity and perfection;” another
is, “A Scriptural Account of the Nature, Original, and Divine
Authority of the Bible, as it is Canonical, in opposition to the
Apocrypha, and all other books of human composition or oral
tradition;” and another is, “On the Evidences of the Divine Original
of the Scriptures; on the Ways and Means of understanding
the Scriptures; and on the Necessity and Excellency of their use
and Study.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The three volumes contain reviews of nearly two hundred books
and other publications; the first of which is a review of “The
Life of the Rev. Thomas Brand; and his Funeral Sermon, by Dr
Annesley.” It is scarce likely that the whole of these reviews
were written by Mr Wesley; but it is more than probable that he
was the reviewer of this work of his wife’s father. He thinks that
“Dissenters and Churchmen will soon be better friends; and
though they may not be able to unite so perfectly as to come
under one form of discipline, yet they may give one another the
right hand of fellowship, and be without any other heat than that
of holy emulation, which shall excel in practical godliness, and in
the lively exercises of those graces that shall be most beneficial to
mankind, and of most edification to the Church of Christ.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The frontispiece of each monthly number is curious: in one
corner, is a clergyman in gown and bands and a broad-brimmed
hat; in another, a scholar writing at a desk; and between the two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>a hive of bees, surrounded by plants and flowers; while above and
below are three mottoes, viz., <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<i>Sic nos non nobis mellificamus
apes</i>;”</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<i>Omnia in libris</i>;”</span> and,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All plants yield honey, as you see,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the industrious chymic bee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is only fair to add, that on the title-page of vol. ii., the
“Complete Library” is said to be “by R. W.,” Master of Arts, but
there can be little doubt that the “R” is a misprint.</p>

<p class='c001'>During Mr Wesley’s retired residence at South Ormsby, he was
engaged in other literary undertakings. In 1693, the year after
the publication of the “Young Student’s Library,” he printed a
new work, entitled, “The Life of our Blessed Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ: An Heroic Poem. Dedicated to her most sacred
Majesty; in Ten Books. Attempted by Samuel Wesley, Rector
of South Ormsby, in the county of Lincoln. Each book illustrated
by necessary notes, explaining all the more difficult matters in
the whole history. Also a Prefatory Discourse concerning Heroic
Poetry; with sixty copperplates. London: Printed for Charles
Harper, at the Flower-de-Luce, over against St Dunstan’s Church,
in Fleet Street; and Benjamin Motte, in Aldersgate Street. 1693.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The volume is folio in size, contains 349 pages, and is divided
into ten books, consisting of nearly 9000 lines. The preface,
which fills fourteen closely-printed pages, is an elaborate production,
and well written. At the close of it, Wesley says he knows
the faults of his book, and would have mended much that is amiss
if he had lived in an age when a man might afford to spend nine
or ten years about a poem.</p>

<p class='c001'>Prefixed to the work are a number of commendatory verses by
Nahum Tate, poet-laureate, and by others. Tate praises the book
and its author to the utmost stretch of poetical eulogium. He
regards Samuel Wesley as one who has completed the task which
Milton left unfinished; and represents him as a great bard emerging
from solitude, fired with rapture, and charmingly unfolding
the great themes of angelic hymns, and weaving wit and piety
together. His spotless muse brings fresh laurels from Parnassus,
and plants them on Mount Zion.</p>

<p class='c001'>L. Milbourne and Peter Anthony Motteaux are equally lavish
of their praises; and both of these writers were men of mark.
It is true that Pope gives Milbourne a niche in his “Dunciad;”
but Dunton, who knew him well, observes concerning him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Most other perfections are so far from matching his, that they
deserve not to be mentioned; his translations are fine and true;
his preaching sublime and rational; and he is a first-rate poet.”
Motteaux was a native of France, and was driven to England by
the revocation of the edict of Nantes. At first, he kept a large
East India warehouse in Leadenhall Street. He was master of
several languages, and, during his residence in England, he acquired
so perfect a knowledge of the English tongue, that he became a
very eminent dramatic writer in a language to which he was not
a native. On his birthday, in 1717, he was found dead in a disorderly
house in London, not without suspicion of having been
murdered.</p>

<p class='c001'>In opposition to such eulogists, it is only fair to state, that
Dunton describes Wesley’s “Life of Christ” as “intolerably dull;”
and it has been asserted, that Alexander Pope had so mean an
opinion of its merits, that, in one of the early editions of his
“Dunciad,” he honoured Wesley with a place in the Temple of
Dulness.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The work was also fiercely assailed by Samuel Palmer,
(to be noticed hereafter,) to whom Wesley replied,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> “I know my
poem is very faulty; but whether it be in itself so absolutely contemptible
as Mr Palmer represents it, I desire may be left to more
impartial judges. If he will be so kind as to let me know the
particular faults of that poem, I shall own myself highly obliged
to him, and will take care to correct them. I am sensible there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>are too many incorrect lines in it, which had better been left out;
but I remember, too, some lines struck out which, perhaps, had
been as well left in. I care not if I oblige him with two or three
of them, which were in the original but were not printed, and
leave him to guess the reason—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Or murmuring deep with harsh incondite tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>With eyes reversed, and many a brutal groan,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Badcock, in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for 1784, tells us that
Wesley’s “heroic poem, the ‘Life of Christ,’ excited the ridicule of
the wits.” John Wesley, in his reply to this, in the same periodical
for 1785, p. 246, simply states, that his father’s own account
of it was, “The cuts are good; the notes pretty good; the verses
so-so.” Samuel Wesley, jun., ardently loved his father, and admired
his genius, but speaks of his “Life of Christ” in the following
measured terms:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whate’er his strains, still glorious was his end:</div>
      <div class='line'>Faith to assert, and virtue to defend.</div>
      <div class='line'>He sung how God his Saviour deigned to expire,</div>
      <div class='line'>With Vida’s piety, though not his fire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>John Wesley, who, though he seldom wrote poetry, had as fine
poetic taste as any member of his family, observes: “In my
father’s poem on the ‘Life of Christ’ there are many excellent
lines, but they must be taken in connexion with the rest. It
would not be at all proper to print them separate.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Adam Clarke, in reference to the same production, writes:
“When a poet, no matter of what abilities, takes for the subject of
his verse the sayings or acts of the Almighty, as recorded in the
Bible, he must of necessity fail, speak untruths, and sink below himself.
Who can add to the dignity, importance, or majesty of the
words of God by any poetical clothing? The attempt to do it is
almost impious; and, in the execution, how many words are attributed
to God which He never spake, and acts which He never did!
The life of our Lord was never found, and never will be found,
but in the four evangelists.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Coke, who published a “corrected and abridged” edition of
Samuel Wesley’s “Life of Christ” more than a hundred years after
the first edition was issued, says in his preface:—“I found the
poet had carefully collected the richest materials, with a sedulity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>that surpassed my expectation, and had arranged them with a
degree of art that nothing but the hand of a master could have
reached. In surveying the character of Christ as here delineated,
no remarkable incident in His life, from the cradle to His cross,
has been omitted; nay, if we even take a wider range, every event
of moment is noted, from the espousals of His mother to His resurrection
from the dead, and His final ascension to glory. Indeed,
the life of Christ, being closely connected with both time
and eternity, presented to the poet an occasion to draw aside the
curtain which divides the visible from the invisible world. Both
heaven and hell are permitted to burst upon us; the former to
ravish us with its glories, and the latter to alarm us with its terrors.
Hence angels and devils pass in review before our eyes; relate
what is past, discover their condition, perform their respective
actions, and retire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley’s poem is far from perfect. In many places it flashes
with the highest kind of genius, and throughout it breathes with
piety. The reader will find hundreds of lines full of poetic beauty;
but then he will find others that are extremely tame, and literally
limp for want of poetic feet. There can be no doubt that Samuel
Wesley wrote too much for his writings to be faultless. “He
wrote <em>very much</em> for me,” says Dunton, “both in verse and prose.”
How much he wrote no one living has the means of knowing.
Dunton says, “he wrote two hundred couplets a day.” He might
do that when composing pieces for the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, but it
is incredible to think that this was done when he was composing
“The Life of Christ;” for, in that case, the whole of that large
folio poem would have been begun and finished in about three
weeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Life of Christ” was first published in 1693. With all
its faults, the edition was soon sold; and in 1697 the author issued
a “revised and improved” edition, with “a large map of the Holy
Land, and a table of the principal contents.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The plates used in this second edition are said to have been
engraved “by the celebrated hand of William Fairthorn;” but if
so, they must have been engraved long before the first edition was
published, inasmuch as Fairthorn died as early as 1691. Fairthorn
was an ingenious artist; but lived a chequered life. As a
royalist, he was taken prisoner at the breaking out of the civil
wars, and for a length of time was confined in Aldersgate. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>place of business was near Temple Bar, where he sold not only his
own engravings, but those of other English artists, and imported
a considerable number of prints from Holland, France, and Italy.
About 1680 he left his shop, and went to reside in Printing
House Yard, where he continued to work for booksellers, until a
lingering consumption put an end to his life in 1691. Such was
Samuel Wesley’s engraver.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the preface of the book, we learn that the poem was
begun in Anglesea and the Isle of Man, and afterwards “completed
in several parts of England.” Wesley says the subject was
first proposed to him by certain of his friends, and that he greedily
embraced it; though, at the time, he knew nothing of the rules
propounded by the masters of epic poetry. In reference to his
object in publishing the book, he writes, “I desire to recommend
the whole of the Christian religion; all the articles of faith; all
that system of theology and morality contained in the gospel of
the blessed Jesus; and to vindicate His mission, His satisfaction,
and His divinity, against all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps enough has been said respecting this folio “Life of
Christ.” Let the curious reader, when he has the chance, purchase
it for himself. The sentiments and the spirit of the book
cannot fail to be of service to every one who gives it a fair perusal;
whilst many of its lines will be found to be ponderous with
thought, and full of genius. As a proof of this, we conclude the
chapter with four quotations. The first is Wesley’s description of
the glorious scene witnessed on Mount Tabor, and is, in fact, the
first piece of the poem:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To Tabor’s mount He beckon’d from the sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two glorious saints who reign’d enthroned on high;</div>
      <div class='line'>Moses, the leader of God’s chosen band,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who nature’s laws inverted with his wand;</div>
      <div class='line'>With him Elijah, who sublimely rode</div>
      <div class='line'>A car of lightning to the throne of God;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus Law and Prophets their perfection find</div>
      <div class='line'>In Him, the hope, the price of lost mankind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus Christ, and Moses, and Elias came,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their persons different, but their views the same.</div>
      <div class='line'>Unrivall’d beauties deck’d the Saviour’s face,</div>
      <div class='line'>His dazzling form the circling glories grace;</div>
      <div class='line'>His seamless coat, than falling snows more white,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enclosed a pillar of transparent light.</div>
      <div class='line'>The two great prophets, who beside Him stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Array’d in light their modest glories show’d.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Thus stars appear, when, twinkling, they display</div>
      <div class='line'>Their feeble lustre to the orb of day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet Moses, who from trembling Sinai came,</div>
      <div class='line'>Appear’d encircled in a robe of flame;</div>
      <div class='line'>While great Elijah, half-conceal’d from sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shone with strange lustre through a cloud of light.</div>
      <div class='line'>Transports of joy fill’d each disciple’s breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too big for utterance, or to be repress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Around their heads celestial clouds arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which rather brighten than conceal the skies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Compared with day they seem’d divinely fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scatter’d odours through the balmy air;</div>
      <div class='line'>Form’d of materials most serenely bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>They shone a tissue of unsullied light.</div>
      <div class='line'>The three apostles, as the clouds prevail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Felt all their spirits and their muscles fail;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their loins relax, their knees no strength impart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear and trembling seize on every heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>Low on the earth, dissolved in reverent fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>They heard a voice, which none but they must hear;</div>
      <div class='line'>The voice of God; no more in frowns express’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>With lightnings written, or in thunder dress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as at Sinai issued forth the Law,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, with dread earthquakes, rock’d the plains below;</div>
      <div class='line'>But all melodious, tranquil, and serene,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which charm’d like music this delightful scene;</div>
      <div class='line'>In words like these the will of God was given,</div>
      <div class='line'>In attestation of the King of heaven:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I thus declare Thee my beloved Son,</div>

<p class='c016'>The following lines on the Deity are what no one but a philosopher

      <div class='line in4'>“Before this beauteous world was made,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Before the earth’s foundations laid,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>He was, He ever is, we know not how!</div>
      <div class='line'>No mean succession His duration knows,</div>

    </div>
  </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>With all due deference to eccentric John Dunton, we submit
that such lines are far from being “intolerably dull.”
They were too hastily written to have the polished rotundity of
poets like Young and Pope; but, notwithstanding this, they are
full of poetic fire. The reader, who is in search of poetic <em>thoughts</em>
rather than poetic <em>sounds</em>, will find himself amply recompensed
by a careful reading of Wesley’s “Life of Christ.” We can hardly
praise the poem so highly as it is praised by Nahum Tate; but,
at the same, we maintain that, for learning, energy of thought,
vivid imagination, picturesque phrases, and forceful language in
general, it is immeasurably superior to scores of other poems,
which, by accident, have been vastly more popular than it has
been. Men brand Samuel Wesley’s poetry without reading it. This
is, in the highest degree, unfair. In the name of a great and much
injured man, we protest against it; and respectfully request that,
for the sake of his memory, and their own benefit, they would
give his poems a careful and candid perusal.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second volume of the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, p. 37, the
question is asked, What books of poetry would you advise one
that is young to read? In the answer, after recommending David’s
Psalms, and the poems of Cowley, Herbert, Chaucer, Milton,
Spenser, Tasso, Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson,
Dr Donne, and Dryden, it is quietly but significantly added, “and,
if you have patience, Wesley’s Life of Christ.” Reader, the
advice is worth taking, though it was probably given by Wesley
himself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br />WILLIAM AND MARY’S REIGN—1689–1702.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>William and Mary were declared King and Queen of England
on the 12th of February 1689. Their reign is marked by great
events—such as the siege of Londonderry, Lord Dundee’s insurrection
in Scotland, the battle of the Boyne, the surrender of
Limerick, the massacre of Glencoe, and the war with France; but
we purposely pass over all civil and military transactions, and confine
our attention to ecclesiastical and literary affairs, with which
Samuel Wesley, as a clergyman and as an author, was more closely
connected.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the first acts of William, after his accession to the throne,
was to give orders that, in his private chapel, the service should
be said instead of sung. This alteration was warranted by the
rubric, and yet it caused among the High Church and half-popish
party a great amount of murmuring.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another of his early acts strangely enough occasioned much
excitement. Touching for the scrofula was a practice which had
come down from the darkest of the dark ages, and William dared
to sneer at it. It had been sanctioned by high ecclesiastical
authority, but even that did not deter the bold monarch from
treating it with contempt. Charles II., in the course of his reign,
touched near one hundred thousand persons. In 1682, only seven
years before the commencement of the reign of William, he performed
the royal rite not fewer than eight thousand five hundred
times. Two years later, in 1684, the throng of scrofulous persons
was such that six or seven of the sick were trampled to death.
King James, two or three years after, touched eight hundred persons,
in the choir of Chester Cathedral. The days for touching were
fixed by the Privy Council, and were solemnly notified by the
clergy in all the parish churches of the realm. When the appointed
time came, several divines, in full canonicals, stood round
the canopy of state, the surgeon of the royal household introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the sick, a passage from 16th chapter of Mark was read, after
which one of the sick was brought to the all-healing monarch.
His Majesty stroked the ulcers and swellings, and hung round the
patient’s neck a white riband, to which was fastened a gold coin.
The other sufferers were then led up in succession, and as each
was touched the chaplain repeated the incantation, “They shall
lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” Then came
the epistle, prayers, antiphonies, and a benediction. Such was the
ceremony of touching for the cure of the king’s evil. The expense
of this ceremony, in the shape of coins put round the sufferers’
necks, was little less than £10,000 a-year. The whole affair was
a huge piece of costly and superstitious foolery, ending in no
beneficial results whatever. We dare to assert this, notwithstanding
the solemn assurance of one of the surgeons of King Charles
II., that the gift of healing was communicated by the unction
administered at the coronation, and that the cures were so numerous,
and sometimes so rapid, that they could not be attributed to
any natural cause whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'>King William had too much sense to be duped, and too much
honesty to bear a part in what he knew to be an imposture.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a> “It
is a silly superstition,” said he, when he heard that, at the close of
Lent, his palace was besieged by a crowd of sick persons: “give
the poor creatures some money and send them away.” Only on
one single occasion was he successfully importuned to lay his
hand on a patient’s sores. “God give you better health,” he said,
“and more sense!” What was the result of this <a id='corr168.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='abandoment'>abandonment</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.26'><ins class='correction' title='abandoment'>abandonment</ins></a></span> of
royal practice? The parents of scrofulous children cried out
against William’s cruelty. Bigots lifted up their hands and eyes
at his impiety. Jacobites sarcastically praised him for not presuming
to arrogate to himself a power which belonged only to
legitimate sovereigns. And even some of his own friends thought
he acted unwisely in treating with such marked contempt a superstition
which had so strong a hold on the vulgar mind. But William
was not to be moved, and was accordingly set down by many
High Churchmen as an infidel, or at least a Puritan.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as William and Mary ascended the throne of England
the new oath of allegiance was tendered. It was conceived in the
simplest form, the words “rightful and lawful sovereigns” being,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>upon mature deliberation, omitted. Notwithstanding this modification,
several members, both of the House of Lords and the
House of Commons, refused to take it. Among these were the
Earls of Clarendon, Lichfield, and Exeter, and likewise seven
bishops, including five who had been sent to the Tower for refusing
obedience to the mandates of James. The spiritual lords who
refused the oath of allegiance to William and Mary were Sancroft,
the primate, Turner, Bishop of Ely, Lake, of Chichester, Ken, of
Bath, White, of Peterborough, Thomas, of Worcester, and Frampton,
of Gloucester. Above four hundred of the clergy, including
some of the highest distinction, followed the example set by Sancroft
and the six bishops, and thus began the schism of the <em>Nonjurors</em>,—a
term which became as prominent as that of <em>Nonconformists</em>
had been under the last two Stuarts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 1st of August, 1689, was the day fixed by Parliament,
before the close of which all beneficed clergymen, and all persons
holding academical offices must, on pain of suspension, swear
allegiance to William and Mary. Above twenty-nine-thirtieths
submitted to the law, but, in general, the compliance was tardy,
sad, and sullen. Many, no doubt, deliberately sacrificed principle
to interest, but they had not fortitude to resign the parsonage, the
garden, and the glebe, and to go forth without knowing where to
find a meal, or a roof for themselves and their little ones. Many
swore with doubts and misgivings; still the thing was done, and
ten thousand clergymen solemnly called Heaven to attest their
promise that they would be loyal to King William. The clergymen
and members of the university, who refused to take the oath,
were about four hundred in number, including the primate and
six of his suffragans.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among these dissentients, there were some who were men of
scholarship and mark, but perhaps it is scarce too much to say,
that there was hardly one who was qualified to discuss any large
question of morals or politics without either extreme feebleness or
extreme flightiness of mind. The following are the most distinguished
among them:—</p>

<p class='c001'>William Sherlock, rector of St George’s, Botolph Lane, prebendary
of St Paul’s, and Master of the Temple; all of which preferments
were taken from him until some years afterwards, when
he took the oath and was reinstated. Dr Sherlock was a good
man, but held extreme opinions. He was the author of several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>publications, but is chiefly indebted for celebrity to his “Practical
Discourse Concerning Death,” a work which went through thirty
editions in a short space of time, has been printed in all sizes and
forms, and has been applauded by the most able critics.</p>

<p class='c001'>George Hickes, born at Newsham, in Yorkshire, and educated
at Northallerton, a fellow and a tutor of Lincoln College, Oxford,
Dean of Worcester, with the prospect of becoming Bishop of
Bristol. He was the author of three volumes of sermons, and of
a multitude of tracts in defence of himself and of the other nonjurors.
Macaulay says, “Of all the Englishmen of his time George
Hickes was the most versed in the old Teutonic languages, and his
knowledge of the early Christian literature also was extensive.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jeremy Collier, lecturer at Gray’s Inn, a man of intrepid courage,
indefatigable industry, and unsullied integrity; the author of
three volumes of essays on moral subjects; of a translation of
Moreri’s “Historical Dictionary,” in four volumes folio; of an
“Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain,” &amp;c. Macaulay writes:—“Jeremy
Collier was a good man, of eminent abilities, and a great
master of sarcasm and of rhetoric. To his eloquence and courage
is to be chiefly ascribed the purification of our lighter literature
from that foul taint which had been contracted during the Anti-puritan
reaction. His reading, too, though undigested, was of immense
extent: but his mind was narrow, his reasoning singularly
futile and inconclusive, and his brain almost turned by priestly
pride.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry Dodwell, Camden Professor of History in the Oxford
University, a man of great learning, of extensive reading, and of
unwearied application, of undissembled piety, and unimpeached
integrity; a man of great benevolence, and who religiously abstained
from almost all kinds of food three days every week; and
yet a man of paradoxical notions, narrow religious sentiments, and
who, as a writer, enlisted in the cause of infidelity, and attacked
revelation in the disguise of a friend. The brilliant historian
above quoted says:—“Dodwell had perused innumerable volumes
in various languages, and acquired more learning than his slender
faculties were able to bear. The small intellectual spark which he
possessed was put out by the fuel. Some of his books seem to
have been written in a madhouse; and, though filled with proofs
of his immense reading, degrade him to the level of Ludowich
Muggleton. He published a treatise in which he maintained that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>a marriage between a member of the Church of England and a
Dissenter was a nullity, and that the couple were in the sight of
Heaven guilty of adultery. He defended the use of instrumental
music in public worship, on the ground that the notes of the organ
had a power to counteract the influence of devils on the spinal
marrow of human beings. He further maintained that our souls
are naturally mortal, and that the gift of immortality is conveyed
in the sacrament of baptism; but, in order to the efficacy of the
sacrament, it is absolutely necessary that the water be poured,
and the words be pronounced by a priest who has been ordained
by a bishop.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John Kettlewell, born at Northallerton, fellow and tutor of
Lincoln College, Oxford, domestic chaplain of the Countess of
Bedford, and rector of Coleshill in Warwickshire; a celebrated
preacher, a laborious writer; learned without being proud, and
wise without being cunning; devout without affectation, religious
without morosity, and courteous without flattery. His works,
which were numerous, were published in two volumes folio.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles Leslie, chancellor of the cathedral church of the diocese
of Connor, one of the ablest champions the Non-jurors had; a man
of extensive learning and great merit, and the well-known author
of “A Short and Easy Method with the Deists.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To the above, of course, must be added the primate and the
six bishops. Dr Birch, in drawing Sancroft’s character, says:—“He
was slow, timorous, and narrow-spirited; but at the same
time a good, honest, and well-meaning man. He was laborious in
his studies, and had written, perhaps, more with his own hand
than any person of his time. But the three sermons which he
published give us a very low idea of his taste and judgment, and
are more suitable to a disciple of Bishop Andrews than a contemporary
of Dr Tillotson.” Turner, Bishop of Ely, was a man of
higher position than of intellect. Lake, Bishop of Chichester, is
also unknown to fame. Ken, Bishop of Bath, in some respects
was a man of mark; his works, all of a theological and practical
turn, were published in four volumes octavo. He was a man of
great integrity and courage; and, though deprived of his bishopric,
to the day of his death signed himself “late Bishop of Bath and
Wells.” He died in 1710, having been in the habit for many
years of travelling with his shroud in his portmanteau, and which
he always put on when attacked by illness. White of Peterborough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>is scarce worth mentioning. Thomas of Worcester died
during the first year of William and Mary’s reign; and of Frampton
of Gloucester we know nothing which is worth relating.</p>

<p class='c001'>These, then, were the principal men among the Non-jurors;
and these, with four hundred clergymen, forfeited their ecclesiastical
benefices, and formed a sort of <em>non-juring</em> church, avowedly
Jacobite in its political predilections and principles, and, which
for many years, waged a fierce controversy with the Establishment
on the theological aspects of the question which divided them.
The non-juring system had a few lay-adherents, but it extended
beyond the clergy only to a very limited extent. The new sect
was a sect of preachers without hearers. A few had independent
means. Some lived by literature; one or two practised physic.
Thomas Wagstaffe, for example, who had been chancellor of Lichfield,
had many patients, and made himself conspicuous among
them by always visiting them in full canonicals. But these were
exceptions. Most of the Non-jurors found themselves thrown on
the world with nothing to eat and nothing to do. They naturally
degenerated into beggars and loungers, and many of them became
domesticated as chaplains, tutors, and spiritual directors in the
houses of opulent Jacobites.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a> The schism of the Non-jurors, however,
led to great changes among the occupants of Church offices;
and, before the end of the third year of King William’s reign, he
had issued no fewer than eighteen <em>conges</em> for the election of new
bishops. During this brief period, sixteen new prelates, all indebted
for their promotion to the existing government, and recommended
by their attachment to the principles of the Revolution,
were introduced into the House of Lords; and of the whole twenty-six
sees then existing, only ten were left in the possession of persons
who had been bishops in the reign of James.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the 24th of May 1689, the <em>Act of Toleration</em> became law.
This act, long considered as the Great Charter of religious liberty,
has since been extensively modified, and is hardly known to the
present generation except by name. The several statutes passed
between the accession of Queen Elizabeth and the Revolution,
requiring all people, under severe penalties, to attend the services
of the Church of England, and to abstain from attending conventicles,
were left unrepealed; but provision was made that they
should not be construed to extend to any person, who should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>testify his loyalty by taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy,
and his protestantism, by subscribing the declaration against
transubstantiation. The severe Act of Uniformity, the Five Mile
Act, and the Conventicle Act were not repealed, but merely
relaxed; it being provided that dissenting ministers might preach,
if they professed, under their hand, their belief in the Articles of
the Church of England, with a few exceptions, such as, that the
Church has power to regulate ceremonies, that the doctrines in
the Book of Homilies are sound, and that there is nothing superstitious
and idolatrous in the ordination service. But unless the
minister subscribed thirty-four out of the thirty-nine Articles,
and the greater part of two other Articles, he could not preach
without incurring all the punishments which the cavaliers, in the
day of their power and vengeance, had devised for the tormenting
and ruining of schismatical teachers. Such were the terms on
which the Protestant Dissenters of England were, for the first
time, permitted by law to worship God according to their own
consciences. They were, on the above conditions, allowed to attend
their own places of worship, provided they were duly registered,
and had not the doors locked or barred. They were protected
against hostile intrusion, and it was made a penal offence to enter
a meeting-house for the purpose of molesting a congregation.
The only classes of religionists excepted from the benefits of this
act were the Papists and Socinians.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Many of the Dissenters were still dissatisfied, and wished other
matters of grievance to be settled in parliament. Accordingly,
what was called the “Comprehension Bill” was brought into the
House of Lords. The chief object of this bill was to admit Presbyterian
ministers into the Church, without compelling them to acknowledge
the invalidity of their former ordination; and it also
proposed to allow certain ceremonial forms in public worship to
be observed or omitted at discretion.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bill passed the House of Lords; but the Commons considered
the question as more suitable for a convocation; and the
Lords concurred in an address to the throne to that effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>To prepare the way for convocation a royal commission was
issued, authorising certain individuals to meet and propose alterations
in the Liturgy and Canons, and to consider other matters
connected with the Church. The commissioners thus appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>were Lamplugh, Compton, Mew, Lloyd, Sprat, Smith, Trelawney,
Burnet, Humphreys, Stratford, all bishops at the time; also Stillingfleet,
Patrick, Tillotson, Sharp, Hall, Beveridge, Tennison, Fowler,
Grove, and Williams, who were subsequently raised to the
Episcopal bench; and likewise Meggot, Kidder, Aldridge, Jane,
Beaumont, Montague, Goodman, Battely, Alston, and Scott, who,
though distinguished men, never attained to prelatical honours.</p>

<p class='c001'>The commissioners frequently met, but some of the members
absented themselves, especially Dr Jane, the Regius Professor of
Divinity in Oxford, on the ground that alterations were not required,
and that the present was not the season for such discussions.
Burnet says, “We had before us all the books and papers
that the Nonconformists had at any time offered, setting forth their
demands, together with many advices and propositions which had
been made at several times by most of the best and most learned
of our divines; and so we prepared a scheme to be laid before convocation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following are some of the alterations that were proposed:—Chanting
to be discontinued. Apochryphal lessons to be left out
of the calendar. The sign of the cross in baptism to be omitted
when desired. The sacramental elements to be administered in
pews to those who might object to kneeling. The absolution to be
read by deacons. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Gloria Patri</cite></span> not to be repeated at the end
of every psalm. In the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Te Deum</i></span> the words only-begotten Son to
be substituted for <em>thine honourable, true, and only Son</em>. All titles
of the king and queen to be omitted, and the word “sovereign”
only used. The Collects to be revised by Patrick. Sponsors to be
disused if desired. The great festivals, as a rule, to be retained;
but it was not thought desirable that St Valentine, St Chad, St
Swithin, St Dunstan, and St Alphage, should share the honours
of St John and St Paul. The Athanasian creed to be kept in the
Prayer-Book, but Stillingfleet was to draw up a rubric, declaring
that the damnatory clauses were to be understood to apply only
to such as obstinately denied the substance of the Christian faith.
The point of greatest difficulty was that of <em>re-ordination</em>; but it
was at last agreed that the hypothetical <em>form</em> should be adopted
in the case of Dissenters, as in the case of uncertain baptism, in
these words “<em>If thou art not already ordained, I ordain thee</em>.”
Such were some of the alterations proposed by the commissioners.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>It mattered little, however, whether the recommendations of the
commissioners were good or bad. They were all doomed before
they were published; for the clergy were all smarting from being
recently compelled to take the oaths, and were resolved to defeat
a favourite scheme of that government which had exacted from
them, under severe penalties, a submission not easily to be reconciled
to their conscience or their pride.</p>

<p class='c001'>The convocation, it may be observed, though regularly assembled
with every parliament since the Restoration, had done no
business since the year 1662; so that the members were detained
in town, at considerable expense, during the session, merely to go
through the parade of reading the church service in Latin; but
now it was proposed to submit to their consideration most important
changes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The convocation, summoned by the writ of King William,
assembled on the 21st of November 1689. Compton was in the
chair. Beveridge preached a Latin sermon, in which he warmly
eulogised the existing system, and yet declared himself favourable
to a moderate reform. The struggle between the advocates for
change and those who wished to preserve the Liturgy in its present
state commenced at the very outset, in the election of a prolocutor.
Tillotson, who was known to speak the sense both of
the king and queen, and was also supported by the government,
was proposed by Dr Sharp, afterwards Archbishop of York; but
the election of Dr Jane was carried by a majority of two to one.
Jane, of course, belonged to the High-Church party. He had
borne a chief part in framing that decree by which the University
of Oxford ordered the works of Milton to be publicly burned in
the schools; and yet the same man had repaired to the headquarters
of the Prince of Orange, and had assured his Highness that
Oxford would willingly coin her plate for the support of the war
against her oppressor. For a short time Jane had been regarded as
a Whig, now he was a Tory. He had demanded the see of Exeter
as a reward due to his services, but had been refused; and hence
his changed sentiments. At the time several epigrams were written
on the double-faced <em>Janus</em>, who, having got a professorship by
looking one way, now hoped to get a bishopric by looking another.</p>

<p class='c001'>On November 25th the prolocutor was presented to the Upper
House, on which occasion he expatiated on the excellency of the
Church of England, as at present constituted, intimating that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>amendments could be made, and closing with the words, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nolumus
leges Angliæ mutari</i></span>. The Bishop of London, as president of
the Upper House, replied that the clergy ought to be prepared to
make concessions in matters not essential, and that it was their
duty to show some indulgence to the Dissenters under King
William, since some of the bishops and clergy had pledged themselves
to do so in their addresses to King James.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the next meeting, the Bishop of London informed the convocation
that the royal commission was defective, inasmuch as the
great seal had not been attached to it. They were, therefore, prorogued
until the defect was supplied. In the interval, great exertions
were made by the government to bring over some of the
stiffest opponents in the Lower House, but with small success.
On the 4th of December, the royal commission was communicated
to the convocation, by which they were authorised to act. The
commission stated that, “as rites and ceremonies are indifferent
and alterable,” changes might be made according to the exigencies
of times and places, that it was desirable that the canons should
be reviewed, and the ecclesiastical courts reformed. The convocation
was accordingly empowered to treat of alterations, and to
form canons and constitutions, to be submitted to his Majesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The king also sent a message, by the Earl of Nottingham, in
which he expressed his hope that convocation would not “disappoint
his good intentions, or deprive the Church of any benefit
from their consultations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course, it was necessary to acknowledge the royal message,
by an address to his Majesty. This gave rise to vexatious and
most disreputable squabbles; and the result was, that, without any
discussion whatever on the important matters that had been recommended
by the royal commissioners, convocation was dissolved on
February 6, 1690; nor was it suffered to meet again for the transaction
of business for the next ten years. Thus ended the project
for <em>comprehending</em> Dissenters within the pale of the Church of
England, the last attempt of the kind that has been made.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From this time dates the long struggle between the two great
parties of Conformists. These parties, indeed, had, under various
forms, existed within the Anglican communion ever since the
Reformation; but, till after the Revolution, they were not marshalled
in regular and permanent order of battle against each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>other, and therefore were not known by established names. Now
they began to be called the High-Church party and the Low-Church
party. The High-Church party sympathised with James,
and were cool friends to William, and thought that no man
who was an enemy to the ecclesiastical constitution of the realm
ought to be permitted to bear any part in the civil government.
The Low-Church party stood between the Nonconformists and the
rigid Conformists, and contained, as it still contains, two different
elements—a Puritan and a Latitudinarian element. They saw
nothing in the existing polity and ceremonial of the Church of
England which could make it their duty to become Dissenters;
but, at the same time, they held that both the polity and ceremonial
were means, not ends, and that the essential spirit of Christianity
might exist without Episcopal orders, and without a Book
of Common Prayer. They had, while James was on the throne, been
mainly instrumental in forming the great Protestant coalition
against Popery and tyranny, and they continued, in 1689, to hold
the same conciliatory language which they had held in 1688.
They greatly blamed the scruples of the Nonconformists, but
thought the reflections thrown on them by the High-Church party
to be grossly unjust.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>More than one Methodist historian has said that Samuel Wesley
was “a rigid Tory in politics, and a High Churchman in religious
principle;” that he “regarded Charles I. as properly a martyr; and
was very much attached to the interests of James.” I respectfully
doubt, to some extent, the correctness of these assertions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley was not a Jacobite, and, in the first instance,
he was not a Tory. There is no evidence to show that he was
attached to the interests of James; but, on the contrary, he was
disgusted with James’s tyranny at Oxford, and was the author of
the first pamphlet published in defence of the Revolution. John
Wesley says, his father was a Tory, in the sense of being “one
that believes God, not the people, to be the origin of all civil
power;”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> but he likewise asserts, that his “father always praised
God for the happy revolution of 1688.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then as it regards his being a High Churchman;—it is true
that he considered Charles I. as an injured sovereign and properly
a martyr. He held the same opinions as his son John,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>who writes, “All agree that King Charles was a pattern of
piety, sobriety, temperance, and chastity. He could not endure
an obscene or profane word. He was punctual in his devotions,
both public and private. He was rigorously just; but is supposed
to have been sometimes wanting in sincerity. He was a good
father, a good master, and a good husband; yea, a fond one, which
was the chief source of his troubles, together with the wrong bias
towards arbitrary power which had been instilled into him from
his infancy. But for this, he would have been one of the most
accomplished princes that ever sat upon the English throne.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
But allowing that Samuel Wesley held such opinions,—what then?
Is that a proof that Samuel Wesley was, “in religious principle,
a High Churchman?” We greatly doubt it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The High-Church party were most bitter opponents of Tillotson,
the leader of the Low-Church party; whereas, Samuel Wesley was
his ardent admirer, and even excessive eulogist. The High-Church
party were most vehemently opposed to the scheme of Tillotson
and King William, for “Comprehension,” or the uniting of Conformists
and Nonconformists; while on the other hand, the Low-Church
party desired its adoption; and, in this respect, Samuel
Wesley agreed with them. He was in favour of admitting the
Dissenters within the pale of the Established Church, and, therefore,
we infer that he was in favour of the modification of church
rites and ceremonies, as recommended by Tillotson and his friends
in 1689. The following is an article taken from the <cite>Athenian
Oracle</cite>, (vol. i. p. 301,) and was probably written by Samuel
Wesley himself, or at all events, it was sanctioned by him, as one
of the chief members of the Athenian Society:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“A Comprehension, or the uniting of Conformists and Nonconformists,
is undoubtedly necessary for the reforming of England.
1. Because the schism itself, on which side soever the fault lies, is a
great sin and scandal, and highly needs reformation. That there
is a schism is as plain as that one and one are not one, but two;
since there are different churches, different communions, and
hearers more different and opposite than either. 2. This union is
further necessary, even to <em>personal reformation</em>, because the want
thereof has so much obstructed it; persons being more concerned
for their own particular tenets than for common Christianity;
nay, entertaining the most bitter, scurrilous, and profane scoffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>against the contrary party, even in their most solemn and religious
performances, with approbation and pleasure. Thus while one
laughs at the other’s preaching, and the other at his praying, the
Atheist laughs at both, and there are very many that believe
neither. 3. Another reason is, because we see not how the ancient
church discipline, so much desired, and the loss thereof so much
lamented, can ever without this be renewed. As things now
are, let a person be excommunicated in our Church, he has the
Dissenters to fly to; in theirs, he flies to us, or indeed keeps
between both, rails at all, and is of neither. 4. Again, while
this fatal and scandalous division lasts, it cannot be avoided, but
there will still be different interests, and that powerful ones,
whose struggle will be not only dangerous to the State, but breed
animosities, strife, and bitterness in the different parties.”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such were Samuel Wesley’s arguments in favour of the attempt
to bring Dissenters within the pale of the Church of England. This
was not the language of the High-Church party; for that party
were most stoutly opposed to the propounded scheme altogether.
Samuel Wesley was no partisan of theirs; and it is a most unaccountable
mistake for respectable writers to suppose he was. If
he was a <em>party</em> man at all, he unquestionably belonged to the
Tillotson or Low-Church party. It is true, that ten or twelve
years afterwards, he was brought into most painful collision with
his Dissenting brethren; but the fault was not his so much as Mr
Clavel’s. The controversy that then took place was mournfully
bitter, but it was prompted more by politics than by religion;
and though it led to a full and final separation between him and
his old Dissenting friends, yet we are not aware that there is a
particle of evidence to show, that after this he imbibed any of the
supercilious and superstitious notions generally entertained by the
High-Church party of the present day. He held his ecclesiastical
and political principles clearly, conscientiously, and firmly; but he
was not a bigot; and, if such a confederacy as the Evangelical
Alliance had then existed, he could, without a scruple, have become
a sincere and active member of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before leaving the High and the Low Church parties in the
days of King William, it may be added, that though the Low-Church
clergymen were a minority, and not a large minority, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>their profession, their weight was much more than proportioned
to their numbers. We should probably overrate their numerical
strength if we were to estimate them at a tenth part of the priesthood.
Yet it will scarcely be denied that there were among them
as many men of distinguished eloquence and learning as could be
found in the other nine-tenths put together.</p>

<p class='c001'>The head of the Low-Church party was the king. He had been
bred a Presbyterian; he was, from rational conviction, a Latitudinarian;
and personal ambition, as well as higher motives,
prompted him to act as mediator among the Protestant sects. He
was bent on effecting three great reforms in the laws touching
ecclesiastical matters. 1. To obtain for Dissenters permission to
celebrate their worship in freedom and security. 2. To make
such changes in the Anglican ritual and polity, as, without offending
those to whom that ritual and polity were dear, might conciliate
the moderate Nonconformists. 3. To throw open civil
offices to Protestants without distinction of sect. The first of these
only was attainable. He came too late for the second, and too
early for the third.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While the preceding events were happening in England, other
events of great importance took place in Scotland. There Episcopacy
was abolished, being a great and insupportable grievance
to the nation, and contrary to the inclinations of the generality of
the people. An act was also passed, in 1690, ordaining that all
Presbyterian ministers yet alive, who had been thrust from their
charges since 1661, or banished for not conforming to Prelacy,
should forthwith be restored to their churches, their manses, and
their glebes; and, by another act passed on the 7th of June, in
the same year, parliament ratified and established the Westminster
Confession of Faith, as the public and avowed confession of the
Scottish Church; and restored the government of the Church
by kirk-sessions, presbyteries, provincial synods, and general
assemblies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the opposite effects of the Revolution upon the National
Church in the two ends of the island,—in England consolidating
and confirming the established Episcopacy,—in Scotland
sweeping it utterly away, and in its place re-erecting the old abolished
edifice of presbytery on broader and deeper foundations
than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The position in which the Revolution placed the generality of
Protestant Dissenters has been explained in the account given of
the Toleration Act, which was the only measure passed in their
favour. From the benefits of this act the Roman Catholics and
the Socinians were excluded; and, in 1699, the former were placed
under greater restrictions than ever. It was then enacted by parliament,—1.
That a reward of a hundred pounds should be paid
to every person who should apprehend any Popish bishop, priest,
or Jesuit, and prosecute him to conviction, for saying mass, or
exercising any other part of his office, within these realms. 2. That
the priest so convicted should be adjudged to perpetual imprisonment.
3. That the keeping of a school by any Papist should be
punished by the same penalty. 4. That every person, educated in
the Popish religion, or professing the same, who, within six months
after attaining the age of eighteen, should not take the oaths of
allegiance and supremacy, and also subscribe the declaration against
transubstantiation, the invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the
mass, should be incapable of inheriting, or taking by descent, any
lands, tenements, or hereditaments; and that the next of kin, being
a Protestant, should inherit the estates of which the Roman
Catholic was thus deprived. 5. That all Papists should be incapable
of purchasing any lands, either in their own names or in
those of any other persons.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This was a monstrous Act of Parliament; but when we take into
consideration the sneaking perfidy, coarse brutalities, and bloodthirsty
cruelties practised by Papists during late years in Ireland,
in Scotland, and even in England itself,—when we remember that
Papists in foreign lands were concocting dark intrigues against
the British throne and British nation, recently rescued from the
tyranny of papal domination,—and when we remember further,
that, as lately as the year 1692, De Grandval, a captain of French
dragoons, instigated by the Popish King James, had entered into
a conspiracy against the life of King William, and had been shot
for his intended assassination,—and that, in 1696, there had been
another more widely ramified Popish plot for the same infernal
purpose, which resulted in three of the conspirators being executed
at Tyburn,—we are prepared to understand why Papists
were excluded from the benefits of the Toleration Act, and why
they were made the subjects of the legalised persecution of the act of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>1699, “for the further preventing of the growth of Popery.” Abstractedly
considered, the act was monstrous, and merits reprobation;
but severe maladies sometimes need severe remedies to
effect their cure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our space forbids any further review of ecclesiastical affairs during
William and Mary’s reign; and we must now content ourselves with
miscellaneous notices of this eventful period in English history.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1690 occurred the death of a man whose name, despite his
almost insane eccentricities, will always occupy a place in English
Church annals. More than forty years had elapsed, says Macaulay,
since George Fox had begun to see visions and to cast out
devils. He was then a youth of pure morals and grave deportment,
with a perverse temper, with the education of a labouring
man, and with an intellect in the most unhappy of all states;
that is to say, too much disordered for liberty, and not sufficiently
disordered for bedlam. At the time, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Independents, and Baptists were refuting and reviling each other.
He applied in vain for spiritual direction and consolation. One
jolly old clergyman told him to smoke tobacco and to sing psalms;
another counselled him to go and lose some blood. After some
time, he came to the conclusion that no human being was competent
to instruct him in divine things; and that the truth had been
communicated to himself by direct inspiration from Heaven. He
argued that, as the confusion of languages began at Babel, and
that, as the persecutors of Christ put on the cross an inscription
in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, the knowledge of languages, and
more especially of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, must be useless to a
Christian minister. One of the most precious truths revealed to
this new apostle was, that it was falsehood and adulation to use
the second person plural instead of the second person singular.
To say good morning or good evening was highly reprehensible,
for the phrases evidently imported that God had made bad mornings
and bad evenings. To talk of the month of March was to
worship Mars; and to talk of Monday was to pay idolatrous
homage to the moon. A Christian was bound to face death itself
rather than touch his hat to the greatest of mankind. Bowing
was considered as the effect of Satanical influence, for the woman
in the gospel, while she had a spirit of infirmity, was bowed together,
and ceased to bow as soon as divine power had liberated
her from the tyranny of the evil one.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Fox long wandered from place to place, teaching this strange
theology, shaking like an aspen leaf in his paroxysms of fanatical
excitement, forcing his way into churches which he nicknamed
steeple-houses, interrupting prayers and sermons with clamour
and scurrility, and pestering rectors and justices with epistles
much resembling burlesques of those sublime odes in which the
Hebrew prophets foretold the calamities of Babylon and Tyre.
He soon acquired great notoriety by these religious feats. His
strange face, his nasal chant, his immovable hat, and his leather
breeches, were known all over the country. He was repeatedly
imprisoned and set in the stocks, sometimes justly, for disturbing
the public worship of congregations; sometimes unjustly, for
merely talking nonsense. He soon gathered round him a body of
disciples, some of whom went beyond himself in absurdity. He
also made some converts, as Barclay and Penn, to whom he was
immeasurably inferior in everything, except the energy of his convictions.
By these converts his rude doctrines were polished into
a form somewhat less shocking to good sense and good taste. His
gibberish was translated into English; and his system so much
improved that he himself might have been excused if he had
hardly known it. To the last his disciples professed profound
reverence for him; and his crazy epistles were received and read
in Quaker meetings all over the country. This founder of the
Quaker sect died in 1690.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As already intimated in a previous chapter, Samuel Wesley,
like Macaulay, had no great liking for the Quakers. The following
article, taken from the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, vol. i. p. 331, in
which the Quakers and Papists are compared, will tend to show
his opinions concerning a sect which were much more numerous
about two hundred years ago than they are at present, and whose
views and vagaries then were much more wild than happily they
are now:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Both Quakers and Papists are so bad that they can hardly
be called Christian. In many things they are near akin. The
Quakers, ever since their rise, have been looked upon as the
Jesuit by-blows. The Quakers deny the plenary satisfaction of
Christ, and rest on their own merits; so do the Papists. They
rail at our ministers, and deny their legal call or ordination; so
do the Papists. They pretend to a greater strictness and singularity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of life than other people; so do several orders among the
Papists. Then, for fanaticism and enthusiasm, they are most
admirably matched. But, to consider them asunder—The Papist
holds more than he ought to do, and therefore all the articles of
the Christian faith: but the Quaker much less, for the Quakers all
deny the Christian sacraments, and we wonder how they have a
face to pretend to what they never had, Christianity, when they
were never christened. They are indeed a compendium of almost
all sorts of heresies: for they not only deny the merits of Christ,
with the Papists, but even His satisfaction and divinity, being at
best no better than mere Arians. Nay, there have been some of
them who, as far as we can understand them, deny our Saviour’s
manhood, and turn angels, spirits, heaven, and hell into mean and
jejune allegories. All of them, to a man, whom we ever met with,
deny the Scriptures to be the <em>Word of God</em>, and most of them
deny any resurrection of the body. For these reasons, we think,
as a bad Christian is better than none, so a Papist is better than a
Quaker.”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This may seem a caricatured description of the Quakers’ religion,
but it must be borne in mind that in 1690 that religion was not
the systematised and inoffensive thing that it is in 1865.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the members of the Low-Church party, in the reign of
William and Mary, Tillotson stood the highest in general estimation.
He was the son of a clothier, and was born at Sowerby
Bridge, in Yorkshire, in 1630. His first sermon was preached at
the morning exercise in Cripplegate, in 1661. Thirty years afterwards
he was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, in the
Church of St Mary le Bow. The congregation was the most
splendid that had been seen in any place of worship since William
and Mary’s coronation. The crowds that lined the streets greeted
the new primate with loud applauses; but the applauses of his
friends could not drown the roar of execration which the Jacobites
and High-Church party set up against him. According to them,
he was a thief, who had entered not by the door, but had climbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>over the fences. He was an Arian, a Socinian, a Deist, an Atheist.
He had never been christened, for his parents were Anabaptists.
He had lost their religion when a boy, and he had never found
another. In ribald lampoons he was nicknamed “Undipped
John.” The parish register of his baptism was produced in vain.
This storm of obloquy, which he had to face for the first time at
more than sixty years of age, was too much for him. His spirits
declined, his health gave way, and in 1695 he died, and Samuel
Wesley, his sincere and warm admirer, wrote and published his
elegy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tillotson was sincere, frank, and humble; of kind and tender
affection, bountiful in his charities, and forgiving of injuries.
After his death, there was found a bundle of bitter libels which
had been published against him, on which he had written with
his own hand, “I forgive the authors of these books, and I pray
God that He also may forgive them.” His public principles were
philanthropic, tolerant, and liberal. William and Mary reposed
an entire confidence in his prudence, moderation, and integrity.
In some points he was, perhaps, too compliant, and was led into
some inconsistencies; but the times were difficult, and his intentions
were always good. While he was in a private station of life,
he always laid aside two-tenths of his income for charitable uses;
and when he died, his debts could not have been paid if the king
had not remitted his first fruits. As a preacher, he was thought,
by his contemporaries, to have surpassed all rivals, living or dead.
Posterity has reversed this judgment. Yet Tillotson still keeps
his place as a legitimate English classic. His highest flights were
indeed far below those of Taylor, of Barrow, and of South; but
his oratory was more correct and equable than theirs. No quaint
conceits, no pedantic quotations from Talmudists and Scoliasts,
no mean images, buffoon stories, or scurrilous invectives, ever
marred the effect of his grave and temperate discourses. His
style is not brilliant, but it is pure and transparently clear. He
is always serious, and always good. His sermons were published
in three volumes folio. Addison considered them as a standard
of the purity of the English language; and Dryden acknowledged
that, if he had any talent for English prose, it was derived from
frequent perusal of Tillotson’s writings.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1694, on December 28, Queen Mary died, and Samuel
Wesley composed and published a poem eulogising her character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Being seized with smallpox, Mary gave orders that every lady of
the bed-chamber, every maid of honour, nay, every menial servant,
who had not had the smallpox, should instantly leave the
house. She locked herself up during a short time in her closet,
burned some papers, and arranged others, and then calmly awaited
her decease. William remained night and day by her bedside;
and a few moments before she expired he was removed, almost
insensible, from the sick-chamber. The public sorrow at her
death was great and general. When the Commons next met
they sat for a time in profound silence. The number of sad faces
in the street struck every observer. On the Sunday which followed
her death, her virtues were celebrated in almost every
parish church of the capital, and in almost every great meeting-house
of the Nonconformists. The funeral was the saddest and
most august that Westminster had ever seen. The two Houses,
with their maces, followed the hearse; the Lords, robed in scarlet
and ermine; the Commons in long black mantles. No preceding
sovereign had ever been attended to the grave by a parliament;
for, till then, the parliament had always expired with the sovereign.
The whole magistracy of the city swelled the procession.
The banners of England and France, Scotland, and Ireland, were
carried by great nobles before the corpse. The pall was borne
by the chiefs of the illustrious houses of Howard, Seymour, Grey,
and Stanley. On the gorgeous coffin of purple and gold were
laid the crown and sceptre of the realm. The day was well
suited to such a ceremony. The sky was dark and troubled.
The nave, choir, and transept of the abbey were in a blaze <a id='corr186.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='with with'>with</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_186.27'><ins class='correction' title='with with'>with</ins></a></span>
innumerable wax-lights. The body was deposited under a
sumptuous canopy in the centre of the church, while the primate
preached; and throughout the whole ceremony the distant booming
of cannon was heard every minute from the batteries of the
Tower.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As long as Queen Mary lived, William left the management of
the affairs of the English Church wholly in her hands, and her
chief confidant and counsellor was Archbishop Tillotson.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever was Mary’s character and conduct as a daughter and
a sister, she was certainly the most devoted and exemplary of
royal wives. Though, in accordance with the atrocious practice
of sovereigns, her husband kept a mistress in the palace, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>she had the good sense to submit to his commanding intellect.
John Wesley says, she “was in her person tall and well-proportioned,
with an oval visage, lively eyes, agreeable features, a mild
aspect, and an air of dignity. Her apprehension was clear, her
memory tenacious, and her judgment solid. She was a zealous
Protestant, scrupulously exact in all the duties of devotion, of an
even temper, and of a calm and mild conversation.” She was
excellently qualified to be the head of the English court. She
was English by birth, and English also in her tastes and feelings.
Her face was handsome, her port majestic, her temper sweet and
lively, her manners affable and graceful. Her understanding,
though very imperfectly cultivated, was quick. Feminine wit
sparkled in her conversation; and her letters were so well expressed
that they deserved to be well spelt. She took much
pleasure in the lighter kinds of literature, and did something towards
bringing books into fashion among ladies of quality. The
stainless purity of her private life, and the strict attention which
she paid to her religious duties, were the more respectable, because
she was singularly free from censoriousness, and discouraged
scandal as much as vice. Her charities were munificent and judicious,
and though she made no ostentatious display of them, it
was known that she retrenched from her own state in order to
relieve Protestants whom persecution had driven from France and
Ireland, and who were starving in the garrets of London.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The reign of William, her husband, extended to the year 1702.
During the thirteen years that William wore the crown, the Bank
of England was founded; the East India Company was reorganised;
and the plantations or settlements of America and the
West Indies so steadily increased, that, before his death, they employed
not less than five hundred sail of ships. Sir Godfrey
Kneller and Sir Peter Lely were the chief portrait-painters of the
day; Purcell was the chief musician; and Sir Isaac Newton was
shedding a glory over his age and country by his sublime scientific
discoveries. The higher kinds of literature were at a discount for
want of court patronage. Dryden, fallen on what to him were
evil days and evil tongues, and forced in his old age to write for
bread, with less rest for his wearied head and hand than they had
ever had before, now produced some of his most laborious and
also some of his happiest works; and Lee, the dramatic poet, discharged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>from Bedlam, finished two more tragedies; but besides
these, there were hardly any poets above the rank of Shadwell,
Tate, and Brady. Among other writers belonging to the same
period may be mentioned:—Bishop Stillingfleet, who had been
known as an author thirty years before William’s accession to
the throne; Cumberland, Bishop of Peterborough, an exceedingly
learned writer, who, at the age of eighty-four, began to study, and
mastered the Coptic language, was now in the full zenith of his
fame; Bishop Bull was writing his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Judicium Ecclesiæ Catholicæ,”</span>
for which he received the thanks of the whole body of the
clergy in France; good old Richard Baxter, who had been filling
the world with books for half a century, just lived to see the Revolution,
and died in 1691; Dr Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury,
was plying his prolific pen, which, during his lifetime, produced
one hundred and forty-five distinct publications; Robert
South, immortalised by his masculine, if not spiritual sermons,
was carrying on a controversy with Sherlock respecting the Trinity;
and John Locke was publishing his “Essay Concerning the
Human Understanding.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The population of England, in the reign of King William,
was about seven millions. About ten thousand of these were
clergymen, with an average income of £60 each per annum.
The average wages of labouring people and out-door servants
were five shillings and ninepence farthing per week; and the
average income of cottagers and paupers fourpence farthing per
day.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Such was the state of things when Samuel Wesley was
flourishing among his two hundred peasant parishioners at South
Ormsby, on £50 a year and a parsonage,—an income nearly equal
to the average income of the ten thousand clergy living at that
period.</p>

<p class='c001'>King William died on the 8th of March 1702. Samuel Wesley’s
son John says—“Upon the whole, William III. appears to
have been an honest, conscientious man, fearing God, and desirous
to please Him. His good qualities were many, his ill ones few;
so that we may well rank him among the best of the English
princes.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At eighteen William sat among the fathers of the Commonwealth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>grave, discreet, and judicious as the oldest among them.
At twenty-one he was placed at the head of the administration.
At twenty-three he was renowned throughout Europe as a soldier
and politician. His personal tastes were those of a warrior rather
than of a statesman; but he occupies a far higher place among
statesmen than among warriors. From a child he had been weak
and sickly. In the prime of manhood his complaints had been
aggravated by a severe attack of smallpox. He was asthmatic
and consumptive. His slender frame was shaken by a constant
hoarse cough. He could not sleep unless his head was propped
by several pillows, and could scarcely draw his breath in any but
the purest air. Cruel headaches frequently tortured him. Exertion
soon fatigued him. Yet, through a life, which was one of
long disease, the force of his mind never failed, on any great occasion,
to bear up his suffering and languid body.</p>

<p class='c001'>His frame was slender and feeble; his forehead lofty and
ample; his nose curved like the beak of an eagle; his eye bright
and keen; his brow thoughtful and somewhat sullen; his mouth
firm and somewhat peevish; and his cheek pale, thin, and deeply
furrowed by sickness and by care. He possessed strong natural
sense and rare force of will. Long before he reached manhood,
he knew how to keep secrets. Meanwhile, however, he made but
little proficiency in fashionable or literary accomplishments. His
manners were altogether Dutch, and even his countrymen thought
him blunt. To foreigners, he often seemed churlish. He was
entirely destitute of sociability. He seldom came forth from his
closet; and when he appeared in the public rooms, he stood among
the crowd of courtiers and ladies stern and abstracted, making no
jest and smiling at none. His freezing look, his taciturnity, the
dry and concise answers which he uttered when he could keep
silence no longer, disgusted noblemen and gentlemen, who had
been accustomed to be slapped on the back by their royal masters,
called Jack or Harry, congratulated about race cups, or rallied
about actresses. The women also missed the homage due to their
sex. They observed that the king spoke in a somewhat imperious
tone even to the wife to whom he owed so much, and whom he
sincerely loved. Another thing, which was regarded as one of
his misfortunes, was his bad English. He spoke our language,
but not well. His accent was foreign, his diction was inelegant,
and his vocabulary seems to have been no larger than was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>necessary for the transaction of business. English literature he
was incapable of enjoying or of understanding. He never once,
during his whole reign, showed himself at the theatre. Next to
hunting, his favourite amusements were architecture and gardening.
He had some talent for sarcasm, and frequently employed
a natural rhetoric, quaint indeed, but vigorous, and original.
From a child, he listened with interest when questions of alliance,
finance, and war were discussed. He understood Latin, Italian,
and Spanish; and spoke and wrote, with more or less correctness,
English, French, and German. The Dutch was his own tongue.
For all persecution he felt a fixed aversion. His theological
opinions were loose, but were more decided than those of his
ancestors; and predestination was the keystone of his religion.
Since Octavius, the world had seen no such instance of precocious
statesmanship. He died at the age of fifty-two.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br />LAST DAYS AT SOUTH ORMSBY—1694–1696.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We must return for a little while to South Ormsby, small, but
neat and picturesque, and the first home of Samuel and Susannah
Wesley. Here they lived about five years. Here the rector’s wife
brought him one child additional every year, and did her best to
make £50 per annum go as far as possible. Here he plied his
pen with unceasing diligence, and wrote many of his articles for
the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>, and also his contributions to the “Young
Student’s Library,” and “The Complete Library, or News for the
Ingenious;” here he finished his “Life of Christ,” and here he
composed two other poems, which must now be noticed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Queen Mary died at the end of the year 1694; and her confidential
friend and adviser, Dr Tillotson, died two months afterwards.
In 1695, Samuel Wesley published, in a sort of folio pamphlet of
twenty-nine pages, his “Elegies on the Queen and Archbishop.”
The title of the first is as follows:—“On the Death of her late
sacred Majesty, Mary, Queen of England, a Pindarique Poem.”
The title of the second is—“A Poem on the Death of his Grace,
John, late Archbishop of Canterbury.” The Elegy on the Queen
consists of twenty-five verses of from twenty to thirty lines each;
and that on the archbishop of sixty-two verses of four lines to a
verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both the poems are written in the highest style of eulogy. The
following are the first lines of the Elegy on the Queen. The
death of Mary is represented as a judgment inflicted on account
of the sins of the nation, and is also considered as the harbinger
of other judgments to follow. The reference to the Shechinah is
in bad taste, and almost profane:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ah, sinful nation! Ah, ungrateful Isle!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>See what thy crimes at last have done!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At last thy Shechinah is gone;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy beauteous sun no more must on thee smile,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Thy dove is shelter’d in the ark;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The heavens are silent all and dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark as thy fate,—or where,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through horrid rifts, some streaks of light appear,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They bode a dreadful flood</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of fire and blood.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The following is from the twenty-fifth stanza, and is meant to
be descriptive of Mary’s admission into heaven. The extract is
inserted with reluctance; but, in delineating character, faults as
well as virtues must be noted:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How was heaven moved at her arrival there!</div>
      <div class='line'>With how much more than usual art and care,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The angels, who so oft to earth had gone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And borne her incense to the Eternal’s throne,</div>
      <div class='line'>For her new coronation now prepare!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How welcome! how caressed!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Among the blest!</div>
      <div class='line'>And first mankind’s great mother rose—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Give way, ye <em>crowding souls</em>!’ said she,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘That I the second of my race may see!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding our high veneration for Samuel Wesley, we
feel bound to say that such lines are fulsome foolishness. Upon
the whole, Mary was a good woman, but Wesley’s eulogy of her
is sadly excessive:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Would virtue take a shape, she’d choose to appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think, and speak, and dress, and live like her.</div>
      <div class='line'>Zeal without heat, devotion without pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Work without noise, did all her hours divide;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wit without trifling, prudence without guile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pure faith, which no false reasoning e’er could spoil,</div>
      <div class='line'>With her, secured and blest our happy Isle.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The poem on Tillotson is written in the same eulogistic strain.
The primate is represented as one who excelled in pulpit, church,
and state. As a preacher, he taught without noise, and differed
from others without strife. As a prelate, he was watchful, humble,
wise. As a statesman, unambitious and upright:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Twas music, poetry, and rapture all,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The sweets of his orac’lous words to share;</div>
      <div class='line'>As soft they fell, as balmy dewdrops fall,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As smooth as undisturbed ethereal air.</div>
      <div class='line'>One word you cannot take away;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Complete as Virgil’s, his majestic sense;</div>
      <div class='line'>To twenty ages of the world, shall stay,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The standard he of English eloquence.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Dr Adam Clarke properly observes, that “great and good as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>both the queen and archbishop were, both their characters are
sadly overdrawn, and their praises are extended even beyond poetic
licence. These, and some other of Mr Wesley’s early productions
excited the ridicule of the wits, and made him the subject of such
an occasional squib as the following, written by John Dunton:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Poor harmless Wesley, let him write again;</div>
      <div class='line'>Be pitied in his old heroic strain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let him in reams proclaim himself a dunce,</div>
      <div class='line'>And break a dozen stationers at once.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr Wesley, as we have seen, was an enthusiastic, an almost
idolatrous, admirer of Queen Mary and of Archbishop Tillotson;
and some writers have been pleased to intimate that this arose
from special favours which her Majesty and the archbishop had
shown him. This is an unwarranted and unworthy insinuation.
It cannot be denied that Wesley received kindness from the queen;
but there is no evidence to show that he was indebted to Tillotson
for any favour whatever. Wesley himself declares, in a letter to
be given hereafter, that because he dedicated his “Life of Christ”
to Queen Mary, the queen gave him the Epworth living. He
never asked for it. “It was proffered and given without his ever
having solicited any person, and without his ever expecting, or
even once thinking of such a favour.” He adds, “The favours
which our blessed queen was pleased to bestow on me, after she
had read my book, were as far beyond my expectation as my
desert.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that all this is substantially correct; though
it involves a discrepancy in dates, which it is hard to reconcile.
Wesley says that it was through the queen that he obtained Epworth
living; and yet he was not inducted into that living until
two years after the queen was dead. The probability is that the
queen made some arrangement that Wesley should be the next
presentee to Epworth benefice; and, after her decease, the arrangement
was carried out. Be that as it may, it is an unquestioned
fact, that Wesley was indebted to the kindness of Queen Mary;
but it is an unwarrantable imputation to say that it was because
of this that he used such excessive flattery in Queen Mary’s Elegy.
We find the same extravagant praises used concerning her in the
very book which led to the Epworth living being given; thereby
showing that Wesley was a most warm admirer of the queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>before he received any of her royal kindnesses. After having
lauded the virgin mother of our Saviour, he adds:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And after thee, oh full of charms and grace!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let our great Mary fill the second place!</div>
      <div class='line'>For other queens long mayst thou look in vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Others like her, to fill thy glorious train.</div>
      <div class='line'>Humble like thee, like thee of royal line,</div>

</div>

<p class='c016'>In this way we dispose of the imputation, that Wesley’s extravagant
eulogies of Queen Mary would not have been written if
Queen Mary had not shown him favour. The thing is false,
for he wrote such eulogies before any favour had been granted.
His eulogies may be foolish, but they are not fawning. He loved
his queen, and therefore praised her.</p>

<p class='c001'>As it respects the archbishop, there is not a scrap of evidence
to show that Wesley was ever indebted to him for kindness of any
kind; on the contrary, it was through Tillotson that Wesley was
not made an Irish bishop. Hence the following extract from a
letter written by his Grace only four months before Mary’s death.
The letter was addressed to the Bishop of Salisbury, and is dated
“Lambeth House, August 31, 1694.” The primate says:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lord Marquis of Normanby having made Mr Waseley<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
his chaplain, sent Colonel Fitzgerald to propose him for a bishopric
in Ireland, wherewith I acquainted her Majesty; who, according
to her true judgment, did by no means think fit. Their Majesties
have made Dr Foley Bishop of Down, and Dean Pulleyn
Bishop of Cloyne.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And so, in all likelihood, Dr Foley or Dean Pulleyn obtained the
bishopric which the Marquis of Normanby wished to obtain for
Samuel Wesley. We know nothing of the history and merits of
these gentlemen. Perhaps they were well qualified for the Episcopal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>station to which they were exalted, or perhaps they were
not; for bishoprics have not always been given to men the best
qualified and the most deserving. It is not improbable that, in
learning and talent, Samuel Wesley was vastly superior to Dr
Foley and Dean Pulleyne; but we cannot, on this ground, commend
the wisdom of the application made by the Marquis of
Normanby, or argue that at present Samuel Wesley was fit to be
made a bishop. Wesley was only thirty-two years of age; it was
not more than six years since he had been ordained; and his
ministry, during that period, had been, to a great extent, confined
to a small parish of not more than two hundred and fifty inhabitants.
He had neither age nor experience sufficient for the Episcopal
office. Normanby’s application was hasty and imprudent;
and the disapproval of the archbishop and the queen was seemly
and right. At the same time, the letter of the archbishop above
quoted, is written in terms so frigid as to lead to the conclusion
that, however much Samuel Wesley admired the archbishop, the
feeling was not reciprocal, and was of no advantage to the poor
rector who cherished it.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have already seen that the Marquis of Normanby was one
of Wesley’s warm-hearted friends. It was through this nobleman
that he obtained the living of South Ormsby.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> His lordship had
a house in the parish, and Wesley acted as his chaplain. The
Marquis was well acquainted with the poor, hard-working, literary
parson, and was well able to estimate his character and his
merits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Normanby was a remarkable man, and was descended from a
long series of illustrious ancestors. He was the son of the Earl of
Mulgrave, and was born in 1649. He was early distinguished
for his bravery and accomplishments. The inefficiency of his tutor
induced him, at twelve years of age, to educate himself; and
his literary acquisitions are the more wonderful, inasmuch as
those years in which they are commonly made, were spent by him
in the tumult of a military life, or the gaiety of a court. At seventeen,
when war was declared against the Dutch, he engaged as
a volunteer on board the ship in which Prince Rupert sailed, and
was rewarded for his zeal by the command of one of the independent
troops of horse then raised to protect the coast. When
another Dutch war broke out in 1672, he went again a volunteer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the ship which the celebrated Lord Ossory commanded; and his
behaviour was such that he was advanced to the command of the
<i>Catherine</i>, the best second-rate ship in the navy. In 1674, he
was installed Knight of the Garter, and made one of the lords of
the bedchamber to Charles the Second, with whom he was a great
favourite. He afterwards went into the French service to learn
the art of war under Turenne. When the unlucky Monmouth fell
into disgrace, he was recompensed with the lieutenancy of Yorkshire
and the government of Hull. Having had the boldness to
aspire at courting Lady Anne, afterwards Queen of England, King
Charles,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> in 1680, sent him out to Tangiers, intentionally, it is
said, in a leaky ship, hoping that he would either perish at sea, or
in battle with the Moors on land. The Moors, without a contest,
retired before him, and he returned to England in safety; was
well received by the king, and continued a wit and a courtier as
before. On the accession of James the Second, he was admitted
into the Privy Council and made lord-chamberlain. He accepted
a place in the high commission; and, having few religious scruples,
he attended the king at mass, and kneeled with the rest, but
refused to be converted. He lamented, but acquiesced in the revolution,
and voted for the conjunctive sovereignty of William
and Mary. For some years, he looked on King William with
malevolence, and lived without employment; but, notwithstanding
this aversion, he was made Marquis of Normanby in 1694, and,
about the year 1700, was received into the Cabinet Council with
an annual yearly pension of £3000. On the accession of Anne
in 1702, he was made Lord Privy Seal, and then was created Duke
of Normanby, and afterwards Duke of Buckingham. He died in
1720, at Buckingham House in St James’s Park, an edifice which
he had erected himself, leaving a son by his third wife, a natural
daughter of King James by the Countess of Dorchester. He
was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey, where a monument
is erected to his memory, bearing an inscription of his
own composition, beginning; “In doubt, but not in wickedness,
I lived. In doubt, but not in fear, I die.” He wrote the “Vision,”
and other poems; two tragedies, called “Julius Cæsar” and “Brutus,”
and several prose works, consisting chiefly of historical memoirs,
speeches in parliament, characters, dialogues, and essays. As
a poet, he scarcely exceeds mediocrity; though Pope and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>were sufficiently influenced by his rank and patronage, to place
him high among the votaries of the muse. Johnson’s criticism is
severe. “He is,” says he, “a writer that sometimes glimmers, but
rarely shines, feebly laborious, and at best but pretty. His songs
are upon common topics; he hopes, and grieves, and repents, and
despairs, and rejoices, like any other maker of little stanzas; to
be great, he hardly tries; to be gay, is hardly in his power. His
verses are often insipid, but his memoirs are lively and agreeable;
he had the perspicuity and elegance of an historian, but not the
fire and fancy of a poet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same authority describes his character somewhat harshly.
He writes:—“His character is not to be proposed as worthy of
imitation. His religion he may be supposed to have learned from
Hobbes, and his morality was such as naturally proceeds from
loose opinions. His sentiments, with respect to women, he picked
up in the court of Charles; and his principles, concerning property,
were such as a gaming table supplies. He is said, however,
to have had much tenderness, and to have been very ready to
apologise for his violences of passion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, then, was the man who obtained for Samuel Wesley the
living of South Ormsby, and in whose house Samuel Wesley acted
as domestic chaplain. The year in which he asked that Wesley
might be made an Irish bishop, was the year in which he himself
was created Marquis of Normanby. Had his request been preferred
to King James, or to Queen Anne, it would probably have
been successful, but with King William and Queen Mary he was
no favourite.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Marquis of Normanby was a distinguished man, but his principles
and morality were loose, and Samuel Wesley’s position, as
domestic chaplain, was not always the most comfortable. There
can be little doubt that the following question and answer in the
<cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, (vol. i. p. 542,) were written by Wesley, and
refer to his own office in the family of the marquis:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>Question.</i>—I am a chaplain in a certain family, which is not so
regular and religious as I could wish it. I am forced to see
misses, drinking, gaming, &amp;c., and dare not open my mouth against
them, supposing from the little notice that is taken of me in matters
of religion, and the great distance my patron keeps, that if
I should pretend to blame anything of that nature, it would occasion
nothing but the turning me out of the family. In the meantime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>unless I do speak, and modestly remonstrate, I think I do
not what becomes a minister of religion, and am afraid may
another day be justly condemned as partaker in other men’s sins.
Therefore, gentlemen, my humble request is to know of you what
I ought to do, neither to betray the cause of religion nor give
offence. I would gladly be satisfied how far a chaplain is obliged
to take care of the morals of the family he lives in. Your answer
may be of use to a great many beside myself, for my case is far
from being singular. I cannot believe that to say grace and read
prayers now and then, when my patron is at leisure, is all the duty
of a chaplain, yet I find that we all think we have done enough
when we have done that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>Answer.</i>—The pulpit is a privileged place, where, as custom
has given you authority to speak, so you may with prudence so
moderate your discourse as either to accomplish a reformation, or
at least acquit yourself and discharge your own duty. Righteousness,
temperance, and the judgment to come, if reasoned upon, as
they were almost seventeen ages since, may find a second Felix.
The pulpit is the most proper, and sometimes the only, place to
convince strangers of their faults, but private retirements are
convenient for friends and familiars. These are rules of latitude,
but all the world is reducible to one of them, and the practice is
indisputable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt “the misses, drinking, and gaming,” of the Marquis
of Normanby’s house, occasioned the chaplain much uneasiness
and distress of mind. The marquis was kind, but he was a rake;
and Wesley was brought into company, not only with him but with
his mistresses. To a man like himself, of the highest honour and
strictest principles, this was extremely trying. At length matters
came to a crisis. The following is given on the authority of Mr
Wesley’s son John:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Marquis of Normanby had a house in the parish of South
Ormsby, where a woman who lived with him usually resided.
This lady <em>would</em> be intimate with my mother, whether <em>she</em> would
or not. To such an intercourse my father would not submit.
Coming in one day, and finding this intrusive visitant sitting with
my mother, he went up to her, took her by the hand, and very
fairly handed her out. The nobleman resented the affront so outrageously,
as to make it necessary for my father to resign the
living.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Such, then, was the occasion of Samuel Wesley leaving South
Ormsby. This happened about the year 1696. While, however,
Wesley resigned the South Ormsby living, he retained his chaplaincy
in the house of the Marquis of Normanby. Four years
after this, in 1700, when he published his “Short Discourse on
Baptism,” he announced himself on the title page as “Chaplain to
the Most Honourable John Lord Marquis of Normanby;” and a
year later, in 1701, he dedicated his “History of the Old and New
Testament” to the Marchioness of Normanby, in a prosaic but
flattering dedication; while about the same time, to relieve Wesley
from some of his financial embarrassments, the marquis, with his
own hand, gave him twenty guineas, and the marchioness five!
All this shows that, though his rupture with the marquis’s mistress
rendered it expedient that he should remove from the parish
in which she lived; he still, for years afterwards, retained his
office in the marquis’s family, and participated in the practical
friendship of both him and the marchioness his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the years that Mr Wesley spent at South Ormsby five
or six children seem to have been born to him. Samuel, the
eldest of the family, was born in London; the names of the five
or six, born at South Ormsby, were Susannah, Emilia, Annesley,
Jedidiah, Susannah, and Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first, Susannah, died in April 1693, when a little more
than two years old. Emilia was baptized by her father in South
Ormsby church, January 13, 1692. Arriving at womanhood she
married a Quaker, an apothecary at Epworth, of the name of
Harper, who left her a young widow. Her husband was a violent
Whig, and she was an unbending Tory. About five years before
her father’s death, she became a teacher at the boarding-school of
a Mrs Taylor, in Lincoln, where she received bad treatment and
worse wages. In 1735 she set up a school of her own at Gainsborough.
For many years before her death, she was maintained
entirely by her brothers, and lived at the preachers’ house adjoining
the chapel in West Street, Seven Dials, London. She died at
nearly eighty years of age, about the year 1770. She is reported
to have been beautiful in face and figure, and majestic in her
address and carriage, and to have had “strong sense, much wit,
a prodigious memory, and a talent for poetry.” She was a good
classical scholar, and wrote a beautiful hand. John Wesley said
she was the best reader of Milton that he ever heard.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Annesley and Jedidiah were twins. They were baptized December
3, <a id='corr200.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1794'>1694</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.2'><ins class='correction' title='1794'>1694</ins></a></span>, and both of them died in infancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Susannah, the second, was born in <a id='corr200.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1795'>1695</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.3'><ins class='correction' title='1795'>1695</ins></a></span>, and, at the age of
about twenty-six, was married to Richard Ellison, Esq., a man
of good family, who farmed his own estate, and had a respectable
establishment. She was good-natured, very facetious, and a
little romantic, but behaved herself with the strictest moral correctness.
She had a mind naturally strong and vivacious, and well
refined by a good education. Her husband was little inferior to
the apostate angels in wickedness. His mind was common, coarse,
and uncultivated. He was the plague of his wife, and a constant
affliction to her family. After bearing him several children, she left
him, and hid herself in London, where she had considerable helps
from her brother John. Henceforth she firmly refused to see her
faithless and brutal husband, or to have any intercourse with him.
Her son John lived and died an excise-officer in Bristol. Her
daughter Ann married Mr Pierre le Lièvre, a French Protestant
refugee, whose son Peter was educated at Kingswood school, took
orders in the Church of England, and died at Lutterworth, in
Leicestershire. Her daughter Deborah married Mr Pierre Collet,
another French refugee; and her son, Richard Annesley, died at
the age of twenty-seven, leaving two orphan daughters, of whom
Mrs Voysey, the excellent wife of a pious dissenting minister, was
one. Mrs Ellison’s husband was reduced to a state of poverty,
and, through her brother John, obtained alms from Ebenezer
Blackwell.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> It is pleasing to relate that, at length, he became a
reformed man; and that, on the 11th of April 1760, Charles
Wesley writes: “I buried my brother Ellison, and prayed by him
in his last moments. He said he was not afraid to die, and believed
God, for Christ’s sake, had forgiven him.”<a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mary Wesley was born in 1696, and, therefore, just about the
time that her father left South Ormsby. She was married to
John Whitelamb, whom we shall have to notice in a future chapter.
Through afflictions, and, probably, through some mismanagement
in her nurse, she became considerably deformed, and her growth
in consequence was much stinted: but all written and oral testimonies
concur in the statement that her face was exquisitely
beautiful, and was a fair and legible index to a mind and disposition
almost angelic. Her humble, obliging, even, and amiable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>temper, made her the favourite and delight of the whole Wesley
family. She died in early womanhood in becoming the mother
of her first child. John Wesley preached her funeral sermon
at Wroote; and her sister Mehetabel wrote an elegy, which was
published in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for 1736, an extract from
which, on account of its delineation of character and exquisite
poetry, is here subjoined:—</p>

<p class='c016'>Little South Ormsby, to all interested in the history of the
Wesley family, will always be an attractive place. Here Samuel
Wesley spent about six of the best years of his life, and wrote
some of his ablest works. Here he had at least five children
born, and here he buried three. Hither he took his young wife,
and his first-born son, Samuel. Here he had to join his wife in
mourning the death of her father, Dr Annesley; and from here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to Epworth he and his wife took four young children, the eldest
only six years old,—Samuel, Emilia, Susannah, and Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before finally quitting South Ormsby, it ought to be added, that
Samuel Wesley, who took his degree of A.B. at Oxford in 1688,
took his A.M. at Cambridge in 1694. The following notice is
from the University Register, Cambridge:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XI.</span><br />EPWORTH AND CHRISTIAN SOCIETIES—1696–1699.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr Wesley removed to Epworth sometime during the year 1696
or 1697. This point is clearly settled by the inscription on his
tombstone, which states that he died April 25, 1735, and that he
had been Rector of Epworth thirty-nine years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Epworth, in the county of Lincoln, is a small straggling market
town, of about two thousand inhabitants. It is situated
in what is called the Isle of Axholme, a low-lying district, ten
miles long and four broad, surrounded by the three rivers, Trent,
Don, and Idle. The island contains thirty-seven thousand eight
hundred acres of land, and is divided into the seven parishes of Epworth,
Althorpe, Belton, Crowle, Haxey, Luddington, and Owston,
with their respective hamlets attached. Until within a short time
before Mr Wesley’s removal to Epworth, the whole of this district
was little better than a swamp; but, at a great expense, it had recently
been drained, and it is now exceedingly rich and fertile.
Epworth stands in the centre of the island, and on the side of a
small sloping hill. The view from the churchyard is extensive,
terminating on the north with the Yorkshire wolds, and on the
south with Gringley-on-the-Hill; on the east with the town of
Kirton, and on the west with the spire of the church of Laughton-en-le-Morthen.</p>

<p class='c001'>Epworth church is dedicated to Saint Andrew, and consists of a
nave, of aisles, of a chancel, and a tower. The parsonage, first
occupied by Mr Wesley, is thus described in a document dated
1607:—“It consists of five baies, built all of timber and plaster,
and covered with straw thatche, the whole building being contrived
into three stories, and disposed in seven chiefe rooms—a
kitchinge, a hall, a parlour, a butterie, and three large upper
rooms, and some others of common use; and also a little garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>empailed betwine the stone-wall and the south, on the south.”
There was also “one barn of six baies, built all of timber and clay
walls, and covered with straw thatche; with outshotts about it,
and free house therebye.” There was likewise, “one dovecoate of
timber and plaister covered with straw thatche;” and, finally,
there was “one hemp-kiln, that hath been usealeie occupied for the
parsonage ground, and joyning upon the south.” The entire site
of the parsonage and its adjuncts covered about three acres.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
Here Samuel Wesley lived for about nine and thirty years. Let
us trace his history.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very shortly after his removal to Epworth, his daughter Mehetabel
was born. Henry Moore and Adam Clarke say, she was her
mother’s tenth or eleventh child; but that is an evident mistake,
for Mehetabel was born in 1697, which was only the eighth
year after her mother’s marriage.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> The whole of the Wesley family
were gifted with poetic genius, but Mehetabel perhaps shone the
brightest, Samuel and Charles not excepted. From her childhood,
she was gay and sprightly, full of mirth, good humour, and keen
wit. At the early age of eight years, she had made such proficiency
in learning, that she could read the Greek Testament.
When about twenty-seven years of age, she was prevented marrying
a man whom her father called “an unprincipled lawyer;”
and, in the height of her vexation, made the rash vow, either never
to marry another, or to take the first that might offer. Shortly
after, she had an offer of marriage from a man named Wright, a
journeyman plumber and glazier. Her father, fearing that she
might still marry the man who had jilted her, urged her to marry
Wright. She unhappily did so, and found her husband to be utterly
unsuited to her in all respects. Her uncle Matthew gave her
a small marriage portion, and, with this, Wright set up business
for himself. He then began to associate with low dissolute companions,
spent his evenings from home, became a drunkard; and,
by ill-treatment, broke the heart of his wife. In a most exquisite
poetical address to her husband, she speaks of her “heart-breaking
sighs and fruitless tears;” often does she spend “half the lonely
night” in waiting for her absent husband, and then, on his coming
home from his carousals, “curbs her sighs, conceals her cares,”
dashes away her tears; and, to please him, puts on a cheerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“smile.” But despite all her attention and her tenderness, he
still runs to “obscure and unclean retreats,” and associates with
drunken blackguards, who, as a great achievement, grin at “obscene
jests and witless oaths.” She then concludes her poem with the
threat, that if this effort to regain his affection fails, she will abandon
patience, and give herself up to rage and grief, until death
restores to Wright his liberty, and gives him the opportunity “to
laugh when Hetty is no more.”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>This remarkable woman, in after years, found peace with God.
Charles Wesley speaks of her as “a gracious, tender, trembling
soul; a bruised reed, which the Lord will not break; still harassed
with ‘darkness, doubts, and fears,’ but against hope believing in
hope.” This was a few days before she died, in the year 1750.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
John Wesley says, that for some years before her death she was
“a witness of that rest which remains even here for the people
of God.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a><a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Mr Kirk justly remarks, that a careful analysis of
Mehetabel’s mental powers, a full estimate of her highly poetic
genius, and a complete collection of her poems, would form a
volume of no ordinary interest and value.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to return to the parents of this gifted woman:—Very soon
after their settlement at Epworth, Susannah Wesley was bereaved,
by death, of her sister Dunton. Her father died just before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>removal to Epworth; her sister just after. This double bereavement
was a most painful trial. Elizabeth Dunton, like her sister
Susannah Wesley, was a remarkable woman. From her childhood
she was pious. She was so thoroughly acquainted with the Holy
Scriptures, that, if any text was quoted, she could at once tell the
book, chapter, and verse where it might be found. For nearly
twenty years, she kept a diary, and wrote so copiously, that her
experiences and meditations, if printed, would have filled a folio.
“She was a lover of solitude; and Sabbaths, sermons, and sacraments
were the best refreshments she met with in her way to
glory. Her mind was always full of charity towards those who
might differ from her in matters of opinion. She loved the image
of Christ wherever it was formed. In her last sickness, which
lasted about seven months, she never uttered a repining word;
and throughout the whole there was no doubt upon her spirit
as to her future happiness. Among her last utterances were the
following:—‘Heaven will make amends for all; it is but a little
while before I shall be happy. I have good ground to hope that
when I die, through Christ, I shall be blessed. It is a solemn
thing to die. Oh, this eternity! There is no time for preparing
for heaven like youth. I look back with joy on some of the
early years that I sweetly spent in my father’s house. Oh, what
a mercy it is to be dedicated to God <a id='corr208.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='betimes!”'>betimes!’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_208.23'><ins class='correction' title='betimes!”'>betimes!’”</ins></a></span><a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At her own desire, she was buried in Bunhill Fields. Her
funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. Timothy Rogers, M.A.,
and was published in a volume of nearly three hundred pages.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The following is Dunton’s description of her before their
marriage:—“Tall; of good aspect; hair of light chestnut colour;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>dark eyes; mouth small and sweet; air somewhat melancholy,
but agreeable; neck long and graceful; complexion fair; piety
scarce paralleled, and wit solid. She is sweetly modest, and has
all kinds of virtues. She is an agreeable acquaintance, a
trusty friend, and is mistress of all the graces that make a perfect
woman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another place he writes concerning her:—“For the fifteen
years we lived together there never passed an angry look. Her
sympathies with me, in all the distresses of my life, make her
virtues shine with the greater lustre. Like the glow-worm, that
emblem of true friendship, she shined to me, even in the dark.
My head no sooner ached, but her heart felt it. To requite her
love I would have stripped myself to my very skin; yea, mortgaged
my very flesh to have served her. Indeed all our distresses of body
and mind were so equally divided, that all hers were mine, and all
mine were hers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dunton desired Samuel Wesley to write an epitaph for his departed
wife. Wesley complied with the request, and with the
epitaph sent the following significant epistle:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>July 24, 1697</i>.</div>
<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Brother</span>,—It has been neither unkindness to you, with
whom I have traded and been justly used for many years, nor unthankfulness

your several letters; but the hurry of a remove,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a> and my extraordinary

at Gainsborough, at the bishop’s coming hither, which is but just
over. Besides, I would fain have sent you an elegy as well as an
epitaph, but cannot get one to my mind, and therefore you must
be content with half your desire; and if you please to accept
this epitaph, it is at your service. I hope it will come before
you need another epithalamium.—I am, your obliged friend and

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This epitaph was written within two months after Mrs Dunton’s
death. Dunton was professing unutterable distress on account of
his wife’s decease, and Wesley, in his epitaph, represents him as
resolved to heave his agonizing sighs until death should re-unite
them in a more blissful world than this; and yet, in the midst of
all this pretended blubberment, Dunton was sweethearting another
lady, and, before the year was out, actually made her his second
wife. It is more than probable that Samuel Wesley had some
knowledge of this unseemly haste to contract another matrimonial
alliance, when, in the foregoing letter, he expressed the hope that
the epitaph for Dunton’s dead wife would come to hand before he
needed an epithalamium for his second one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley and Dunton had been warm and faithful friends for, at
least, the last fifteen years; but, from this period, their friendship
seems to have entirely ceased, and, ever after, Dunton speaks of
his old friend with unmistakable animosity. “Now my purse is
empty,” snarls Dunton, “nobody knows me. There is the rector
of Epworth, that got his bread by the Maggots I published. He
has quite forgotten me.” Again—“My old friend, Mr Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Wesley, was educated upon charity in a private academy, if we
may take his own word for it in his late pamphlet, which was
designedly written to expose and overthrow those academies. One
would have thought that, either gratitude or his own reputation
among his relations and best friends, might have kept him silent,
though when a man is resolved to do himself a mischief, who can
help it. Mr Wesley had an early inclination to poetry, but he
usually wrote too fast to write well. Two hundred couplets a day
are too many by two-thirds to be well furnished with all the
beauties and graces of that art. He wrote very much for me,
both in verse and prose, though I shall not name over the titles,
because I am as unwilling to see my name at the bottom of them,
as Mr Wesley would be to subscribe his own. Mr Wesley had
read much, and is well skilled in the languages; he is generous
and good-humoured, and caresses his friends with a great deal of
passion so long as their circumstances are anything in order, and
then he <em>drops</em> them. I challenge the rector of Epworth (for he
is not yet ‘My Lord,’ nor ‘His Grace,’) to prove that I injure
him in his character. I could be very <em>maggoty</em> in the character
of this <em>conforming Dissenter</em>; but, except he further provokes
me, I bid him farewell till we meet in heaven, and there I hope
we shall renew our friendship; for, human frailties excepted, I
believe Sam. Wesley a pious man. I shall only add, that giving
this true character of Parson Wesley, is all the satisfaction I ever
desire for his <em>dropping</em> an old friend. I shall leave him to struggle
through life, and to make the best of it; but, alas!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘He loves too much the Heliconian strand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose stream’s ungarnish’d with the golden sand.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I do not speak this out of prejudice to Mr Wesley; (for to
forgive a slight is so easy to me, it is scarce a virtue,) but this
<em>rhyming</em> circumstance of Mr Wesley is what I learn from the
poem called, ‘The Reformation of Manners,’<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a> where are these
words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Wesley, with pen and poverty beset,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Blackmore, versed in physic as in wit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though this of Jesus—that of Job may sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>One bawdy play will twice their profits bring.</div>
      <div class='line'>And, had not both caress’d the flatter’d crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>This had no knighthood seen, nor that no gown.’”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>All this is despicable growling. Dunton accuses Wesley that
he had ceased to be his friend, or, to use his own word, which
twice over he has italicised, because he had <em>dropped</em> him. But
what of that? Had Wesley not had cause to drop him? Was
it nothing that this man, who for fifteen years had been blessed,
in the sister of Susannah Wesley, with one of the best wives
that ever lived, began to sweetheart another within two months
after she was dead, though all the while he was indulging in
noisy grief for his irreparable loss, and was urging Wesley to
write both an epitaph and an elegy, for the devoted and exalted
woman whose place at his hearth and in his bed he was labouring
to fill up with another? Was it surprising that Samuel
Wesley should resent this insult to the memory of his wife’s
sister, and that he should <em>drop</em> the friendship of a man who was
making himself such a fool? Wesley was no longer Dunton’s
<em>friend</em>; but there is no evidence that he became Dunton’s <em>enemy</em>.
On the contrary, when Dunton was crushed with financial embarrassments,
Mr Wesley was not only <em>a</em> creditor, but <em>the chief</em>
creditor, and wrote to Dunton assuring him that he should do
nothing to his prejudice.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Dunton himself confesses this; and
yet, with consummate and most ungrateful impudence, not only
whines about Wesley’s <em>dropped</em> friendship, but malignantly endeavours
to injure Wesley’s fair character.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dunton, in the foregoing extract, insinuates that Wesley had
written articles (we presume in the <cite>Athenian Gazette</cite>) which
were discreditable both to him and to his publisher; but, in the
absence of something more than insinuation, and taking into account
the general character of Wesley’s acknowledged writings, it is
not unfair to say that Dunton’s inuendo is as baseless as it is base.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dunton intimates that Wesley had sought to be made a bishop,
and had cast a longing eye on even the dignity of an archbishop.
The same thing has been broadly uttered in a life of Defoe,
recently written by William Chadwick. This pungent and scurrilous
author says:—“Wesley made his way by flattering royalty;
he could write either prose or poetry, and dedicate his work to the
queen for the time being, and then ask for a living as the reward
of his services. The rectory of Epworth was one produce of his
pen, Queen Mary being the patron. The neighbouring living of
Wroot he obtained for bedaubing with poetic flattery the Duke of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Marlborough, after his victory of Blenheim; and his traducing of
the Dissenters in the eventful year of 1703, was intended, through
the royal patronage, to send this time-serving flatterer into the
Archbishopric of Canterbury, upon the back of that unprincipled
miscreant, Dr Sacheverell.”<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The man that wrote this is as unprincipled as he says Sacheverell
was. His assertions are a tissue of falsehoods, in support of
which he adduces no evidence whatever. Samuel Wesley would
have done no dishonour to a bishop’s bench, but we fearlessly deny
that there is any proof existing, except such as is found in mean
insinuations, like those of John Dunton, that Samuel Wesley ever
even “desired a bishop’s office, much less that he wrote his books
for the purpose of obtaining it.” The whole thing is an unfounded
and slanderous accusation, more disgraceful to the accusers than
it is injurious to the accused. Chadwick, no doubt, founds his
imputations against Wesley upon casual remarks made by men
like Dunton; but when Dunton and others fail to adduce proof,
it is only fair to doubt their correctness, inasmuch as they are
obviously animated by a malevolence which never scruples to utter
falsehoods that are likely to blacken the character of the man it
hates.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as can be ascertained, the first thing Mr Wesley published,
after his removal to Epworth, was a “Sermon preached
before the Society for the Reformation of Manners.” This sermon
was delivered, first, at St James’s Church, Westminster, Feb. 13,
1698, about twelve months after the settlement at Epworth, and
was afterwards repeated at St Bride’s. The text is, “Who will
rise up for me against evildoers? or who will stand up for me
against the workers of iniquity?” (Psalm xciv. 16;) and it is a
curious fact that, sixty-five years after, John Wesley preached
before the same society, from the same text, in West Street
Chapel, Seven Dials.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Society for the Reformation of Manners was first instituted
about the year 1677, which was just before Samuel Wesley
became a student in the Stepney Academy. At that time Dr
Anthony Horneck was at the height of his useful popularity.
Horneck was educated first at Heidelberg, under the celebrated
Spurzheim, and afterwards at Queen’s College, Oxford. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>exercising his ministry in Oxford, and at Doulton, in Devonshire,
he, in 1671, became preacher at the Savoy in London. At the
Revolution he was honoured with the appointment of chaplain to
King William and Queen Mary, and in 1693 became prebendary
of Westminster. He died in 1696. He was a man of
extensive learning; particularly conversant with the Oriental
languages, ecclesiastical history, controversial theology, and casuistry,
and was the author of several pious and learned works.
Dunton says “he was a man of so great usefulness that none saw
him without reverence, or heard him without wonder.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another popular and useful preacher, belonging to the same
period, was Mr Smithies, who was curate of Cripplegate for
thirty years, and preached the morning lecture at St Michael’s,
Cornhill, where he was so well beloved that he sought no other
preferment. The eccentric writer last quoted says, “His faithful
and excellent preaching commanded the attention of men,
and his constancy in it procured their love. He was a most
humble and hearty Christian, and his practical books were in great
esteem.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A third distinguished man must here be mentioned—William
Beveridge. At the university, Beveridge so much excelled in the
learned languages, that, at the age of eighteen, he wrote a Syriac
grammar, and a treatise on the excellency and use of the Oriental
tongues. Three years after, in 1661, he became vicar of Ealing,
in Middlesex, and subsequently he was appointed Rector of St
Peter’s, Cornhill, Prebend of St Paul’s, &amp;c. In 1691, the see of
Bath and Wells was offered him, but he declined accepting it.
In 1704, he became Bishop of St Asaph; and, in this elevated
station, prosecuted with great zeal and diligence every practicable
measure for advancing the interests of religion. He died in 1708,
and left the greatest part of his estate to the societies for propagating
the gospel, and for promoting Christian knowledge.
Beveridge was a voluminous author; and, as a preacher, was so
successful, especially at St Peter’s, Cornhill, that he was denominated
“the great reviver and restorer of primitive piety.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The earnest preaching of these three godly ministers was the
means of converting a considerable number of young men who
applied to them for religious counsel. Beveridge, Horneck, and
Smithies advised them “to meet together once a week, and to apply
themselves to good discourse and things wherein they might edify
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>one another.” They acted upon this advice, and, at every meeting,
made a collection for the poor. By means of the fund thus
provided, numbers of poor families were relieved, and some
were put into a way of trade; sundry prisoners were set at
liberty by the payment of their debts, several orphans were maintained,
and a few poor scholars received assistance at the university.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These converted young men soon found the benefit of their
weekly conferences with each other. Each person related his
religious experience to the rest, and thus they became the means
of building themselves up in the faith of Christ. The reader will
at once perceive that John Wesley’s United Societies of Methodists,
with their weekly class meetings, instituted sixty-two years afterwards,
were almost, if not altogether, an exact revival of these
weekly meetings, begun in 1677.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the better management of their charitable fund, two stewards
were elected in 1678. The meetings were continued until the
accession of James II. in 1685. At this period, all private meetings
began to be regarded with suspicion, and the result was,
that some of the members of these pre-Methodist societies ceased
to attend such weekly assemblies for Christian fellowship; others
became lukewarm in religious matters; and some became extravagant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and vain. A few, however, continued faithful, and resolved
to exert themselves to the utmost in maintaining and increasing
the purity and power of religion in themselves and others. At
their own expense, they set up public prayers, every evening at
eight o’clock, at St Clement Danes, where there was always a
full congregation. They also instituted, in the same church, an
evening monthly lecture, which was preached by the most eminent
divines in London. All this excited attention. The Papists,
then in power, regarded these young Christians with hatred and
anxiety, and exercised their malignant cunning to ensnare them.
Just at this juncture, and probably for political reasons, the name
of “Society” was exchanged for that of “Club;” and instead of
the weekly meetings being held, as heretofore, in the house of a
friend, who might be endangered by such assemblies, they were
held in quiet taverns, where the members could have a room
appropriated to themselves, and where, under the pretext of a
small expenditure in tavern refreshments, they could safely recite
their religious experience, and confer on plans of religious usefulness.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the accession of William and Mary to the throne, in 1689,
religious secrecy was no longer needed, and the societies now began
to extend the sphere of their operations. At first their chief object,
in their weekly meetings, was to afford to each other mutual
assistance in their Christian life; but, now, they enacted a rule
that every member should endeavour to add to the society at least
one other member. This led to an amazing increase of their
numbers, and the result was that similar societies were multiplied
in all parts of London.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a> This led some ill-affected persons to
report to the bishop of the diocese that these societies were engendering
religious pride, and would issue in a church schism.
A vindication was sent to the bishop, stating that the only object
the members had, was to quicken each other’s affections towards
spiritual things, and to assist each other to live in all respects as
Christians. The bishop was satisfied, and said, “God forbid that
I should be against such excellent designs!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The charge against the societies of intending to create a schism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>was most unfounded; for so far was it from their purpose to form
a sect, that they carefully guarded against the possibility of this,
by their strict attendance at the monthly sacrament, by the use
of many of the church prayers in their private meetings, by their
setting up public prayers in many of the city churches, and by
their humble deference to their respective ministers, without
whose approbation no rule, prayer, or practice was allowed among
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is also noteworthy that great care was exercised in admitting
persons to membership among them. It was required that those
who were desirous of joining the society should furnish a testimony
of their sense of spiritual things, and of their sincere intention
to live a religious life; and this testimony was often presented
in writing.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length, these associated societies of converted people took
another step, and resolved to exert themselves to check the public
and scandalous sins which were so rampant in the capital. At
first, they scarcely knew how to act; but, just at the time when
the resolution was adopted, four or five gentlemen of the Church
of England, well acquainted with the law, formed a similar resolution,
and determined to do all they could, by legal authority, to
chastise and suppress the impudent vices and impieties so prevalent
among their fellow-citizens. The first step taken was to
make an abstract of all the penal laws against vice and profanity,
and to draw up prudential rules for the legal conviction of
offenders. The next was to obtain, through Tillotson, in 1691,
a letter from Queen Mary, requiring magistrates to act in such
matters, and to enforce the laws. The Lord Mayor, the aldermen,
and other magistrates of London consented; and now copies of
the abstract of penal laws, of the prudential rules that had been
drawn up, of the queen’s letter, and of the magistrates’ answer,
were sent all over the kingdom; and blank warrants were
deposited in divers places of the capital for the convenience
of informers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, (vol. iii., p. 30,) tells us that the good
and great men of the age prosecuted the affair with unheard-of
vigour; and many persons of quality met together to concert
measures to help forward this crusade against the profanities of
the city. A petty sessions was held once a-week in Bloomsbury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Court-house and Hick’s Hall for the conviction of offenders; and
another was about to be set up in Westminster.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Fit persons
were appointed to districts all over the city and suburbs, to take
informations and fill up warrants. The queen commanded military
officers to put down wickedness and disorders among soldiers.
To lessen and prevent debauchery, the time for holding Bartholomew
Fair was to be diminished, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this created great excitement. A lawyer, in a coffee-house,
publicly declared that the whole thing was a trick of the magistrates
for the purpose of getting fees, and that he would give them
£2000 for their emoluments during a single year. This, says
the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, was a scandalous untruth, for already one
hundred and forty warrants had been granted for which not one
farthing had been charged for fees; and things were being so
well managed, that, though it was likely that ten thousand warrants
would be granted during the next twelve months, it would
not be in the power of the officers levying the penalties to make
the least profit by their legal prosecutions.</p>

<p class='c001'>This royal, and almost national movement, could not have been
more opportune. The religious societies had resolved to make an
attempt to suppress and to punish vice, but scarce knew how to
act; just at this juncture the steps were taken above recited, and
now the way was open. Accordingly, the societies met together
and prepared for action, by adopting the five following rules,
which, in the prosecution of their work, were to be religiously
observed:—</p>

<p class='c001'>1. Christian poverty of spirit, to be cultivated by a deep sense
of their own impurity and imperfection.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. A disinterested mind, wholly renouncing all carnal ends.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Habitual prayer to God, with a courageous and unwearied
pursuit of such things as are agreeable to His will, and subservient
to His glory.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. Unfeigned charity towards all men, especially to their
souls.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. Quiet resignation to the Providence of God in all events.</p>

<p class='c001'>The societies now began their work, having really become the
Society for the Reformation of Manners. One section of the
members were appointed to act in London, and another section to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>act in Westminster. Prompt information was given to the magistrates
of all the debaucheries and profanities they witnessed; and
not a few were the reproaches and threats they met with from
evil-doers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very soon these converted people, belonging to the religious
societies, were joined by an association of housekeepers in the
Tower Hamlets, who, for their own protection, had banded themselves
together to put an end to the thieving and lewdness that
abounded in that neighbourhood.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> The results were—several
Sunday markets were abolished; some hundreds of brothels were
shut up; music halls, which had degenerated into nurseries of
licentiousness, were closed; multitudes of swearers, Sabbath-breakers,
and drunkards, were legally convicted; and above two
thousand prostitutes, night-walkers, and keepers of houses of ill-fame,
were sentenced by the magistrates as the law directed; many
of them being punished by fines, others by imprisonment, others
by a suppression of their licences, and not a few by being publicly
whipped at the cart’s tail.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were bold steps to take, but they were not unneeded.
Daniel Defoe, writing at that period, has drawn a terrific picture
of the age. The following are lines taken at random from his
poems. There are others far too vivid to be reprinted:—</p>

<p class='c016'>Woodward tells us that, in the music halls, it was not unusual
for persons of both sexes to dance together in shameless nakedness;
and that, within a brief period, there had been above twenty
murders committed in these licentious concert rooms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s description of the morals of the city and of
the nation is appalling. In the sermon which he preached before
the Society for the Reformation of Manners, in 1698, he writes:—“Our
infamous theatres seem to have done more mischief to
the faith and morals of the nation than Hobbes himself. With
as much reason may we exclaim against our plays and interludes
as did the old zealous fathers against the pagan spectacles, and as
justly rank these, as they did the others, among those pomps and
vanities which our baptism obliges us to renounce and to abhor.
What communion hath the temple of God with idols?—with those
abominable mysteries of iniquity, which outdo the old Fescenina
of the heathen, the lewd orgies of Bacchus, and the impious feasts
of Isis and Priapus? I know not how any person can profitably,
or indeed decently, present themselves here before God’s holy
oracle, who frequent those schools of vice, and mysteries of profaneness
and lewdness, to unlearn <em>there</em> what they are taught <em>here</em>
out of God’s Holy Word. It is true the stage pretends to reform
manners; but let them tell us how many converts to virtue and
religion they have made during the last thirty or forty years.
We can give numerous and sad instances to the contrary. A
brave and virtuous nation has been too generally depraved and
corrupted, and nothing has more highly conduced to this than
these insufferable and abominable representations at theatres. If
oaths; if blasphemy; if perpetual profanation of the glorious
name of God and of our blessed Redeemer; if making a scoff and
a laugh of His Holy Word and institutions; if filthiness and
foolish talking, and profane or immodest jesting; if representing,
excusing, and recommending the vices of mankind; if teaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the people to think virtue ridiculous, and religion fit for none but
old people, fools, and lunatics; if contempt of superiors; if false
notions of honour; if lewdness, and pride, and revenge, and even
murder;—if these are the lessons which are daily taught in the
public play-houses, to the disgrace of our age, corruption of our
morals, and scandal of our nation, then we may fairly ask, Are
these fit places for the education of our youth, and the diversion
of those of riper years? or, indeed, are they fit places to be
<em>tolerated</em> under a Christian government?”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley continues:—“Alas! what reason has every one, who
has any real concern for God and for his country, to cry out with
the father of old, ‘To what dregs of time are we reserved!’ Men
may almost print or speak what blasphemies they please with
impunity, and even with triumph. Too many of the subordinate
magistrates will not act, nor the people generally assist them in
the punishment of evil-doers. It is reckoned a part of good breeding,
or at least an argument of wit and spirit, to ridicule all that
is sacred, and to profane the glorious and fearful name of God;
and it is regarded as the rudest and the most clownish thing in
the world to reprove, to detect, and punish such offenders, though
by the most legal, prudent, and advisable methods.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Society for the Reformation of Manners was of great
service, but it was not perfect. Defoe, in his “Poor Man’s
Plea,” alleges that the laws against vicious practices were cobweb
laws, which caught small flies, but which the great ones broke
through. The Lord Mayor whipt about the poor beggars and
a few bad women, and sent them to the House of Correction; and
some alehouse-keepers and vintners were fined for drawing drink
on Sundays; but the man, with a gold ring and gay clothes, might
reel through the open streets, and no one noticed it. The lewdness,
profaneness, and immorality of the gentry, which was the
main cause of the general debauchery of the kingdom, were not
at all touched by the laws as now executed.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are distressing pictures; and it is not surprising that
the converted people, joined together in the religious societies instituted
about 1677, should set themselves the task of suppressing
such impieties, and thus give birth, about the year 1691, to the
Society for the Reformation of Manners. To some extent, the
two Societies were one, and yet they were distinct and separate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>The religious societies were instituted principally to promote
religion among themselves; the Reformation Society to suppress
public vice in others. The religious societies were altogether
composed of members of the Church of England; the Reformation
Society was composed of members of the Church of England, and
of other churches as well.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>After the Society for the Reformation of Manners had existed
about forty years, most of its original members were dead, and it
became defunct, and, from about 1730 to 1757, no such society
existed. At that time, and perhaps as the result of the Methodist
societies being instituted in 1739, the old Society for Reformation
of Manners was revived. The approbation of the Lord Mayor of
London and of the Court of Aldermen was obtained; and thousands
of books of instruction were printed, and were sent to constables
and parish officers to remind them of their duty. In the
beginning of 1758, the laws against immorality were again enforced,
and the streets and fields swept of their notorious offenders.
In five years, about ten thousand persons were brought to justice,
principally for gambling, swearing, Sabbath-breaking, lewdness,
and selling obscene prints.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> Who will deny that John Wesley
had much to do with the revival of this society, as his father,
Samuel Wesley, had to do with its early institution.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> The society,
at the first, arose out of the religious societies then existing;
and we are strongly of opinion that the revival of the society,
after it had become defunct, arose out of the Methodist
societies of 1739, and which bore an almost exact resemblance
to the religious societies of 1677. At all events, we find John
Wesley thoroughly identifying himself with the revived Reformation
Society of 1757. In 1763, he preached before the Society in
West Street Chapel, Seven Dials, taking, as already stated, the
very text that his father took sixty-five years before.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> In 1764,
he proposed to the London Leaders Meeting that they should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>have a congregational collection to assist to liquidate the heavy
debt of the Society for the Reformation of Manners, though, at
the very time, his own society debt in London was about £900.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
And, in 1766, he dined with W. Welsh, the father of the revived
Society, and most feelingly laments that it has a second time
ceased to exist. The immediate cause of this, was an action instituted
against the society, in the King’s Bench, which issued in a
verdict with £300 damages. This verdict was obtained by the
false swearing of a wretch whom the society afterwards convicted
of wilful perjury. Still the death-blow to the Society was struck,
and John Wesley writes: “They could never recover the expense
of that suit. Lord, how long shall the ungodly triumph?”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such, then, was the origin, the object, and the history of the society
before which Samuel Wesley preached, in St James’s Church, Westminster,
in 1698. He was still a young man, and the circumstance
of him being selected to preach, shows the high estimation in which
he was already held. The sermon is long, able, and earnest. “Daring
and open wickedness,” he writes, “is high treason against the
Majesty of heaven; and are not all His liege subjects under the deepest
obligations to oppose it? Who has courage, and constancy,
and bravery, equal to so glorious an undertaking? Blessed be
God! we have now the encouragement of superiors. The sword
of justice no longer lies rusting and idle, but is drawn and furbished
for the battle, and glitters against the enemies of God and
of our country. Shall a wretched mortal, a worm of the same
dust with ourselves, presume to affront my Father, my Patron,
my Friend, my Benefactor, my Saviour, and shall I want courage,
or honesty to oppose him, to detect him, and to bring him to
that shame and punishment he so highly merits? Whom are we
afraid of, that we forget the Lord our Maker? Let all the potsherds
of the earth fall down together, and humble themselves before
the King, the Lord of hosts, and let Him alone be exalted,
whose glory is above the heavens, and who shakes the earth at
His displeasure. Let us often read the lives of martyrs. Here
were Christians indeed,—who trampled the world, subdued the
flesh, and conquered the devil, following the great Captain of their
salvation, as He himself led the way, with crimson banners, and
garments rolled in blood; and shall we pretend to follow them, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>they did Him, and yet be afraid of a few hard words or frowns
from mistaken or evil men? Oh pity! pity! poor sinners, and
pray to God to pity them, who want the sense and grace to pity
themselves; but show your pity to them, not by a cruel fondness,
but by a kind and wholesome severity. Why should we suffer
them to tumble over a fatal precipice, for fear of disturbing or
disobliging them, by pulling them back with some haste and
violence? Go on, then, in the name of God. Remember the eyes
of God, men, and angels, are upon you. Be sober, be vigilant.
Forbid none from casting out devils, because he follows not with
<em>you</em>. Be careful and humble, and all earth and hell can never
hurt you. Be willing, be thankful to be accounted the filth and
offscouring of the world; the disturbers of the public peace, by
those who themselves notoriously break it. Think much of
heaven—forget not death. Be constant at sacraments, and in
prayer, public, domestic, and private. Neglect not to sing the
high praises of God. Remember the poor, especially God’s poor.
Pity the afflicted, especially our dear brethren who now ‘suffer
for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus.’ Oh the peace,
the joy, the triumph, the exultation of mind which a good man
possesses, when he reflects on any sufferings he undergoes for the
cause of God, and for the cause of despised religion and virtue!
He bids the world do its worst, for he has a reserve beyond it,—and
knows who will receive him into everlasting habitations, and
say unto him ‘Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord!’”</p>

<p class='c001'>We have thus attempted to give an outline of the history of
the Society for the Reformation of Manners; and extracts
from Samuel Wesley’s sermon, preached before it in 1698; but,
before the chapter closes, a few words must be added in reference
to the religious societies out of which the other society arose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The religious societies, begun in 1677, continued to exist until
after John Wesley had instituted his Methodist societies. Wesley’s
first society was formed at Oxford in 1729, and consisted of
himself, his brother Charles, Mr Morgan, and Mr Kirkham, who
spent some evenings every week, in unitedly reading the Greek
Testament.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a> The second was formed at Savannah in 1736, where
he met a select few in his own house after evening prayers, and
read and conversed with them, and concluded the meetings with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>a psalm.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> On his return to England, we find him attending the
meetings of the old religious societies which were still existing.
On Sunday, April 26, 1738, he “went to a <em>society</em> in Oxford,
where, as his manner then was at <em>all societies</em>, after using a collect
or two and the Lord’s prayer, he expounded a chapter in the
New Testament, and concluded with three or four more collects
and a psalm.”<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a> In September of the same year, we find him
attending and taking part in <em>society</em> meetings in Bear Yard, in
Aldersgate Street, and in Gutter Lane, London.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a> On the 15th of
November following, he expounded at three <em>societies</em> in Bristol.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
In April 1739, in Bristol, he began “expounding our Lord’s Sermon
on the Mount to a little <em>society</em>, which was accustomed to
meet once or twice a week in Nicholas Street;”<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a> and later on,
in the same month, and in the same city, while “at a little <em>society</em>
in the Back Lane, the floor of the room gave way, and fell down
with a great noise.”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> In June 1739, he “went to a <em>society</em> at
Wapping, where many began to call upon God with strong cries
and tears.”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> On September 9th, he “went to a <em>society</em> at Fetter
Lane, and exhorted them to love one another;”<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a> and two or
three weeks afterwards “went as <em>usual</em> to the <em>society</em> at St
James’s;” and also to a <em>society</em> at Deptford.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> In April, 1740,
we find him at “a little <em>society</em> at Islington, which had stood untainted
from the beginning;”<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a> and in the month of May following,
he met with the “members of a religious <em>society</em> at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
which had subsisted for many years, had a fine
library, and to whom their steward read a sermon every Sunday.”<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>All this affords ample proof that the old religious societies, begun
in 1677, still existed; and there cannot be a doubt that it
was a knowledge of their usefulness that led John Wesley to institute
his united societies in 1739. He tells us that, about that
time, persons who had been awakened to a sense of their sin and
danger, by the preaching of himself and his brother Charles, came
to them for religious counsel and consolation. He writes:—“We
advised them: ‘Strengthen you one another—talk together as often
as you can, and pray earnestly with and for one another, that you
may endure to the end, and be saved.’ They replied, ‘But we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>want you likewise to talk with us.’ So I told them, ‘If you will
all of you come together every Thursday evening, I will gladly
spend some time with you in prayer, and give you the best advice
I can.’ Thus,” he adds, “arose what was afterwards called <em>a
society</em>; a very innocent name, and very common in London, for
any number of people associating themselves together. They
united themselves in order to pray together, to receive the word
of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love, that they
might help each other to work out their salvation.”<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a> A few days
after this society was formed, some of the members expressed a
determination to make a quarterly subscription to assist Wesley
to pay for the lease of the Foundry, and a steward was appointed
to receive the money;<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a> and very soon after that, the society was
divided into smaller companies called “classes,” consisting of
about twelve persons each, and one of whom was styled “the
leader.”<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such is John Wesley’s own account of the rise of his “United
Societies.” In all this, we see an exact repetition of what was
done by Beveridge, Horneck, and Smithies sixty-two years before.
The religious societies instituted by them were the pioneers of
the Methodist societies, and prepared their way. Their origin
and number indicate the existence of a large amount of experimental
and earnest piety, even in the midst of abounding wickedness.
They were immensely useful, and were the means of
conferring great benefits both upon the members themselves
and upon others. They were instrumental in beginning and
establishing about one hundred schools in London and its suburbs,
in which thousands of poor children were taught gratuitously,
and were carefully educated in good manners. Their
rules required, that every member should be a member of the
Church of England; that the members should meet together once
a week to encourage each other in practical holiness; that all controversial
and political discussions should be avoided at their
meetings; that every member should give a weekly contribution
towards the public stock for pious and charitable uses; that every
one absenting himself from four meetings in succession, without
just cause, should be looked upon as disaffected to the society;
that none should be admitted as new members without due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>notice, and without inquiry concerning their religious purposes
and manner of life; and that all the members should pray many
times every day, receive the Lord’s Supper at least once a month,
keep a monthly fast, and pray for the whole society in their private
devotions.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen John Wesley’s connexion with these societies.
What about his father? Was he acquainted with them, and did
he give them his approbation and sympathy? Happily these are
questions which can be answered. “A Letter concerning the
Religious Societies,” was published by Samuel Wesley in 1699.
After giving a description of the societies, Mr Wesley proceeds
to argue that, so far from being any injury to the Church of England,
they would greatly promote its interests. He expresses a
wish that such societies might be formed in all considerable towns,
and even in populous villages. He writes—“There are a great
many parishes in this kingdom which consist of several thousands
of souls. Now what one man, or two, or three, is sufficient for
such a multitude? Those who have but one or two thousand
will find their cares heavy enough, especially now they have neither
the catechists of the ancients to assist them, nor those clerks
which are mentioned in the rubric.” He then goes on to state,
that, in such cases, the religious societies would be of immense
service. Acting under the authority and direction of the clergy,
“they would be as so many churchwardens, or overseers, or almost
deacons under them; caring for the sick and poor, giving an
account of the spiritual estate of themselves and others, persuading
parents to catechise their children and to fit them for confirmation,
and discoursing with those who have left the church to bring
them back to it. This assistance would conduce as much to the
health of the minister’s body, by easing him of many a weary step
and fruitless journey, as it would conduce to the satisfaction of his
mind, in the visible success of his labours. Such societies, so far
from injuring the Church, would be so many new bulwarks against
its enemies, and would give it daily more strength, and beauty,
and reputation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then proceeds to show that the institution of such societies
was not a novelty; that the Church of Rome was indebted for
most of the progress that it had made in recent times to the
several societies it had nourished in its bosom; and that the Marquis
de Renty in France had formed, as early as 1640, many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>societies of devout persons, who, in their weekly meetings, consulted
about the relief of the poor, engaged in united prayer, sang
psalms, read books of devotion, and discoursed together of their
own spiritual concerns.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley then argues that such societies are really necessary, on
the ground, that, without them, the members of the Church have
no opportunity for that “delightful employment of all good Christians,”
pious conversation. He concludes thus:—“The design of
these societies is not to gather churches out of churches, to
foment new schisms and divisions, and to make heathens of all
the rest of their Christian brethren; but to promote, in a regular
manner, that which is the end of every Christian, the glory of
God, included in the welfare and salvation of themselves and their
neighbours. It cannot be denied that there may and will be some
persons in these societies of more heat than light, of more zeal than
judgment; but where was ever any body of men without some
such characters? But since the very rules of their institution do
strictly oblige them to the practice of humility and charity, and
to avoid censoriousness and spiritual pride, the common rocks of
those who make a more than ordinary profession of religion, I
see not what human prudence can provide any farther in this
matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These extracts are important, inasmuch as they afford ample
evidence that Samuel Wesley (the High Churchman, as Mr Watson
and others erroneously call him) was as much in favour of
Christian fellowship, such as Methodists now hold in classes, as
was the founder of the Methodists himself; and they also further
prove that, when John Wesley employed lay agents to assist himself
and his brother, and to promote the glory of God in the salvation
of men, he did nothing more than what had been earnestly
advocated and recommended by his father nearly half a century
before. In employing lay-agents, John Wesley was a-head of his
age; but he only did what his father had urged to be done in
1699, and what the Church of England itself, at this present
moment, is wishing to have accomplished—viz., the employment
of a Sub-Diaconate to co-operate with the regular ministry.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br />DEBT AND DILIGENCE—1700–1704.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Mr Wesley removed to Epworth he turned farmer, and
took the management of his tithes into his own hands. The rector’s
domestic necessities were increasing every year, and it was
natural that he should wish to make his glebe as profitable as he
could. To commence farming, however, was a serious mistake.
First of all, Mr Wesley was without capital to begin; and to
attempt to farm without capital, or to borrow capital and pay large
interest for it, is not the way for a poor man’s prospects to be
made better; and then, in the second place, the great and the
good-hearted rector, notwithstanding his genius, his learning,
and his diligence, seems to have had no aptitude for business,
“He is not fit for worldly business,” wrote his <a id='corr229.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='brother-in-law-Samuel'>brother-in-law, Samuel</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_229.12'><ins class='correction' title='brother-in-law-Samuel'>brother-in-law, Samuel</ins></a></span>
Annesley, who had employed him to transact some of
his affairs in England, whilst he was absent in India; to which
his wife, Susannah Wesley, answered:—“This I assent to, and
must own I was mistaken when I thought him fit for business.
My own experience hath since convinced me that he is one of
those who, our Saviour saith, are not so wise in their generation
as the children of this world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The good man had no knowledge of the farming business; he
had no money to begin it; and, to say the least, his ardent love
of books, and his long-established literary habits, were not friendly
to it. It was a great mistake for the learned and studious rector
to turn farmer, and no wonder that such a step led to debt and
serious embarrassment. Perhaps this is the most fitting place to
introduce the letters following, all of which were written to Archbishop
Sharpe:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'><span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Dec. 30, 1700</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—I have lived on the thought of your Grace’s generous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>offer ever since I was at Bishopthorpe, and the hope I have
of seeing some end, or at least mitigation, of my troubles, makes
me pass through them with much more ease than I should otherwise
have done. I can now make a shift to be dunned, with some
patience; and to be affronted, because I want the virtue of riches,
by those who scarce think there is any other virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I must own, I was ashamed, when at Bishopthorpe, to confess
that I was £300 in debt, when I have a living of which I have
made £200 per annum, though I could hardly let it now for
eightscore.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I doubt not but one reason of my being sunk so far is my not
understanding worldly affairs, and my aversion to law, which my
people have always known but too well. But, I think, I can give
a tolerable account of my affairs, and satisfy any equal judge that
a better husband than myself might have been in debt, though
perhaps not so deeply, had he been in the same circumstances,
and met with the same misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Twill be no great wonder that, when I had but £50 per annum
for six or seven years together, nothing to begin the world
with, one child at least per annum, and my wife sick for half that
time, that I should run £150 behindhand, especially when about
£100 of it had been expended in goods, without doors and within.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I had the rectory of Epworth given me, my Lord of
Sarum was so generous as to pass his word to his goldsmith<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> for
£100, which I borrowed of him. It cost me very little less than
£50 of this in my journey to London, and in getting into my
living, for the Broad Seal, &amp;c.; and with the other £50 I stopped
the mouths of my most importunate creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I removed to Epworth, I was forced to take up £50
more, for setting up a little husbandry, when I took the tithes into
my own hand, and for buying some part of what was necessary
towards furnishing my house, which was larger, as well as my
family, than what I had on the other side of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The next year my barn fell, which cost me £40 in rebuilding,
(thanks to your Grace for part of it;) and, having an aged mother,
who must have gone to prison if I had not assisted her, she cost
me upwards of £40 more, which obliged me to take up another
£50. I have had but three children born since I came hither,
about three years since; but another is coming, and my wife is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>incapable of any business in my family, as she has been for almost
a quarter of a year; yet we have but one maid-servant, in order
to retrench all possible expenses.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My first-fruits came to about £28; my tenths are near £3 per
annum. I pay a yearly pension of £3, out of my rectory, to John
of Jerusalem. My taxes came to upwards of £20 per annum,
but they are now retrenched to about half. My collection to the
poor comes to £5 per annum; besides which, they have lately
bestowed an apprentice upon me, whom, I suppose, I must teach
to beat rhyme. Ten pounds a year I allow my mother, to help to
keep her from starving. I wish I could give as good an account
for some charities, which I am now satisfied have been imprudent,
considering my circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fifty pounds interest and principal I have paid my Lord of
Sarum’s goldsmith. All which together keeps me necessitous,
especially since interest-money begins to pinch me; and I am
always called upon for money before I make it, and must buy
everything at the worst hand; whereas, could I be so happy as to
get on the right side of my income I should not fear, by God’s
help, to live honestly in the world, and to leave a little to my
children after me. I think, as it is, I could perhaps work it out
in time, in half a dozen or half a score years, if my heart should
hold so long; but for that, God’s will be done.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Humbly asking pardon for this tedious trouble, I am, your
Grace’s most obliged and most humble servant,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>S. Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This is a painfully interesting letter. A few explanations may
be acceptable. He had been put to considerable expense “for the
Broad Seal,” the meaning of which is, that, as the Epworth living
belonged to the Crown, his title to the gift of it required the
affixing of the “Broad Seal,” for which, of course, he had to pay
the official fees. Then, he had to pay £28 for “first-fruits;” £3
for “tenths,” and other £3 to “John of Jerusalem.” The “first-fruits”
were a sort of fine levied on a clergyman’s first year’s income,
when he had the good fortune to be promoted, the money
being paid to the Government. The “tenths” were a tax paid to the
Crown <em>every</em> year. The £3 paid to John of Jerusalem was an impost
of the same description. Down to a certain period, a number
of churches in England were obliged to pay toll to the Priory of St
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>John of Jerusalem; but, at the suppression of the monasteries,
all the emoluments of this priory were given to the king, and, as
the rectory of Epworth had been accustomed to pay to the value
of £3 per annum to that house, this was the sum which the kings
of England continued to receive from Epworth rectory.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had been obliged to take a parish apprentice. At that
period, and for a long time after, it was customary for parochial
officers to relieve themselves, of the burden of maintaining the
children of their paupers, by compelling the parishioners, in
rotation, to take such <a id='corr232.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='childen'>children</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_232.10'><ins class='correction' title='childen'>children</ins></a></span> as apprentices, and to teach them
their respective trades. One of these youngsters had been
forced upon the poor rector, and, as he had no trade to teach
him, he playfully proposes to instruct him in the unprofitable
business of making poetry, to which he himself had been so long
addicted.</p>

<p class='c001'>His aged mother was still living, but was crushed with poverty,
and had been in danger of imprisonment for debt. For about
thirty years she had been a lonely widow, and seems to have been
dependent upon her son Samuel’s £10 per annum for her daily
bread. The question naturally occurs, Was the poor rector the
only one willing to assist his mother? Was nothing done for her
by her son Matthew? Matthew rose to considerable eminence in
the medical profession, and had an extensive and profitable practice
in London. Thirty years after the period of which we are now
writing, when he visited the Epworth family, he is represented as
a man of wealth, and yet where is the evidence that he helped to
support his mother? Matthew Wesley is described by his niece
Mehetabel as one of the gentlest of human beings, and as rescuing
thousands from the grave by his healing skill. He was of sufficient
eminence to have his death celebrated in the poetical department
of the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for 1737; but, excepting a little
kindness shown to one or two of his brother’s children, we are left
without evidence that he possessed any of that nobility of heart,
which prompted the embarrassed rector to squeeze out of his
scanty income the pittance which he yearly gave to his much-loved
mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s attachment to the Established Church was conscientious
and strong; otherwise there was enough in his mother’s
history to have made him its enemy for ever. By the relentless
and intolerant bigotry of that Church, her husband had been deprived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of the means of sustaining his family, and had been persecuted
and driven from place to place, and not allowed the opportunity
of providing for either his wife or his children. By the
same Church’s intolerance, he had been brought to an untimely
grave; and his widow, for long, long years, had been struggling
with abject poverty. Her son Samuel knew all this; and yet, notwithstanding
his having been trained for the Dissenting ministry,
he entered the very Church which had inflicted so much misery upon
his father, and which, to the day of her death, made Dr Thomas
Fuller’s niece, Samuel Wesley’s mother, a needy object of charity
and alms. Nothing but conscientious conviction of duty, could
have induced such a man to attach himself to such a Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley was most distressingly embarrassed; but his
embarrassments were not the results of wasteful or extravagant
living. For about eleven years he had been a married minister of
the Church of England. His professional income, for that entire
period—after deducting the payments mentioned in the foregoing
letter, for furniture, the Broad Seal, his first-fruits, his tenths and
other taxes, the poor, his mother’s debt, and also including the
£50 borrowed for farming purposes—did not amount to more than
£600, which gives an average of £54, 10s. a-year, or twenty shillings
and ninepence per week. Out of that amount of money, he
had to maintain house, to find food and clothes for himself and for
his wife; he had to meet the expenses connected with the birth
of ten children, and the burial of five; and he had now a family
to support, consisting of himself, his wife, five children, a maid-servant,
and a parish apprentice-nine persons altogether. Samuel
Wesley, after eleven years of hard struggling, was £300 in debt.
No wonder! Let the reader look at the preceding figures and
facts, and his surprise will be, not that the debt was so great, but
that it was not greater. Many Methodists have a vague idea that
the rector of Epworth was careless and improvident in the management
of his pecuniary matters, and that this was the cause
of his embarrassments; but to entertain such a thought is a cruel
injustice done to the character of that distinguished man, and also
an undeserved stigma cast upon the reputation of his invaluable
wife. Let any one think of a clergyman of the Church of England
having to maintain a large, and often an afflicted family,
for eleven years, at the rate of two shillings and elevenpence-halfpenny
per day, and we challenge him to deny that Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Wesley, now £300 in debt, was deserving not of censure, but of
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archbishop Sharpe, to whom Wesley’s letter was addressed,
was an exceedingly kind and faithful friend. He submitted the
painful circumstances of the poor rector to a number of his noble
friends, some of whom generously responded, the Countess of
Northampton sending him £20. The archbishop also wished to
make an application to the House of Lords for what was technically
called a “Brief;” in other words, a “letter patent, granting
a licence for collecting money to rebuild churches, to restore
loss by fire,” &amp;c. These “briefs,” or letters patent were read in
churches, and the sums collected were endorsed on them, with
the signatures of the minister and churchwarden; after which the
briefs and the money collected were delivered to the person or
persons obtaining the briefs, who in their turn had to give an
account, within two months, of the moneys received, before a
master in Chancery appointed by the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proposal, then, of the Archbishop of York was, to obtain
from Parliament one of these letters patent, authorising and commanding
collections to be made in certain churches, for the purpose
of relieving the distresses of the rector of Epworth. The
feeling which prompted this was unquestionably kind, but perhaps
it was scarce considerate. To a high-minded and sensitive
man like Samuel Wesley, it could not be otherwise than disagreeable
to have his domestic troubles and financial embarrassments
paraded, first before Parliament, and afterwards in parish
churches, for the purpose of obtaining collections to pay some
£300 of debt, and perhaps to furnish a trifling surplus to repair
Epworth parsonage, and to improve Epworth parish church. At
the present day, such a mode of raising money for such purposes
would be universally denounced; and in the case of Samuel
Wesley, one hundred and sixty-five years ago, such a plan ought
never to have been propounded. It was doubtless a duty to
assist the impoverished parson, but the assistance ought to have
been, not public, but private. Dr Clarke asserts that the archbishop
actually applied to the Upper House of Parliament for such
a brief. Be that as it may, we find Samuel Wesley disapproving
of the proposal in the following letter, which was written four
months and a half after his former one:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>May 14, 1701</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—In the first place, I do, as I am bound, heartily
thank God for raising me so great and generous a benefactor as
your Grace, when I so little expected or deserved it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then, to return my poor thanks to your lordship, though
but a sorry acknowledgment, yet all I have, for the pains and
trouble you have taken on my account. I most humbly thank
your Grace that you did not close with the motion which you
mentioned in your Grace’s first letter; for I should rather chose
to remain all my life in my present circumstances, than so much
as consent that your lordship should do any such thing. Nor,
indeed, should I be willing on my own account to trouble the
House of Lords in the method proposed, for I believe <em>mine</em> would
be the first instance of a brief <em>for losses by child-bearing</em> that
ever came before that honourable house.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Had your Grace been able to have effected nothing for me, the
generosity and goodness had been the same; and I should have
prayed for as great a heap of blessings on your Grace and your
family. This is all I can do now, when I have such considerable
assistance by your Grace’s charitable endeavours. When I received
your Grace’s first letter, I thanked God upon my knees for
it. I have done the same, I believe, twenty times since, as often
as I have read it; and more than once for the other, which I received
but yesterday.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, never did an archbishop of England write in such a
manner to an isle poet; but it is peculiar to your Grace to oblige
so as none besides can do it. I know your Grace will be angry,
but I cannot help it; truth will out, though in a plain and rough
dress; and I should sin against God if I now neglected to make
all the poor acknowledgments I am able.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>He then proceeds to mention the great kindness of the Countess
of Northampton, and says he must divide what she has given
him,—“half to my poor mother, with whom I am now above a
year behindhand; the other £10 for my own family. My
mother will wait on your Grace for her £10: she knows not the
particulars of my circumstances, which I keep from her as much
as I can, that they may not trouble her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Very beautiful are sentiments like these; and great must have
been the anguish of that sensitive and noble heart that had to
struggle with such adversities.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Four days after the foregoing letter was written, it was followed
by another and shorter one, strikingly characteristic of the playfulness
as well as gratitude of the writer’s nature:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Archbishop Sharpe, to whom these three letters were addressed,
was born at Bradford, Yorkshire, in 1644. He was educated at
Christ College, Cambridge, and for five years was private tutor to
the four sons of Sir Heneage Finch, who afterwards became Lord
Chancellor. In 1677, Sharpe became rector of St Giles’s, and
had among his parishioners the celebrated Richard Baxter, who
was a constant hearer of the rector every Sunday morning, and
was consulted about his marriage. These two excellent men, notwithstanding
their minor differences, lived together on the most
friendly terms. In 1681, Sharpe was promoted to the deanery
of Norwich. On the accession of King James, he preached so
much against Popery, that he excited the royal displeasure, was
obliged to leave St Giles’s, and to reside altogether at his deanery.
In 1689, he succeeded Tillotson as Dean of Canterbury, and was
nominated one of the commissioners for revising the liturgy. In
1691, he was consecrated Archbishop of York, and discharged
the duties of his high office with great fidelity until his death,
which occurred at Bath in 1714. He preached repeatedly before
King William and Queen Mary. Some of these sermons are
now before us, and display great ability and earnest piety. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>delivered the sermon preached at the coronation of Queen Anne.
His favourite studies, in his youthful days, were botany and
chemistry. He was chaplain to King Charles and to King James.
He was greatly esteemed by King William, and, in the reign of
Queen Anne, the greatest attention was always paid to his advices.
Dr Sharpe, says Bishop Burnet, was a very pious man, and one
of the most popular preachers of the age. Sharpe left behind
him seven volumes of sermons.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a> He was the grandfather of
the celebrated Granville Sharpe, the distinguished philanthropist
and the friend of slaves. A remarkable anecdote of the archbishop
was inserted by John Wesley in the <cite>Arminian Magazine</cite>
for 1785.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the midst of all his pecuniary struggles, Samuel Wesley continued
to write and to publish books. In 1700, he issued a small
volume, entitled, “The Pious Communicant Rightly Prepared; or,
A Discourse concerning the Blessed Sacrament: wherein the
nature of it is described, our obligation to frequent communion
enforced, and directions given for due preparation for it, behaviour
at and after it, and profiting by it. With Prayers and Hymns
suited to the several parts of that Holy Office. To which is
added, A Short Discourse of Baptism. By Samuel Wesley, A.M.,
Chaplain to the Most Honourable John, Lord Marquis of Normanby,
and Rector of Epworth, in the diocese of Lincoln. London:
Printed for Charles Harper. 1700.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This long title almost renders a description of the book unnecessary.
The book, however, besides what is described in the
title-page, contains as an appendix the “Letter concerning the
Religious Societies,” from which quotations have been already
made, and altogether consists of two hundred and ninety-three
pages 12mo. A few extracts may be useful, as illustrating the
writer’s opinions, and his mode of expressing them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of the doctrine of transubstantiation, he says:—“It
overthrows the very nature of a sacrament, and leaves nothing for
an outward sign; it introduces the most monstrous absurdities,
which, if granted, would render the Christian religion the most
absurd and most unreasonable in the world; it involves the most
horrid, as well as most ridiculous consequences, such as that our
Saviour did eat His own body, and gave it to His disciples to eat;
it makes Christians the worst cannibals to eat their God a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>times over; and it contradicts the very nature of a body,
which cannot be in two places at the same time, much less in
earth and in heaven,” (p. 19 and 20.)</p>

<p class='c001'>On the subject of baptism, he writes:—“In baptism, we are so
far regenerate as to be grafted into the body of Christ’s Church,
and to partake of its privileges by the operation of His Holy
Spirit within us, who will never be wanting to us or forsake us,
unless we ourselves put a bar to the divine assistance by confirmed
evil habits, and by a wicked life. But since the divine image,
which we there recovered, is very often obscured again by the
temptations of the world and the devil, and the remains of sin
within us, there is need enough for our being renewed again by
repentance; nor has God here left us without hope or comfort,
but has appointed a remedy even for those who sin after baptism,
and that is this other sacrament of the body and blood of the
Lord, wherein we renew our covenant with Him, and receive new
strength to obey His commands,” (p. 37.)</p>

<p class='c001'>In another place he writes:—“We say not that regeneration
is always <em>completed</em> in baptism, but that it is begun in it; a
principle of grace is infused, which we lost by the fall, which
shall never be wholly withdrawn, unless we quench God’s Holy
Spirit by obstinate habits of wickedness. There are <em>babes</em> as well
as <em>strong men</em> in Christ,” (p. 205.)</p>

<p class='c001'>The same view of baptism was substantially held by his son
John. The latter, in his sermon on the New Birth, observes:—“It
is certain our Church supposes that all who are baptized in
their infancy are, at the same time, born again; and it is allowed
that the whole office for the baptism of infants proceeds upon
this supposition. Nor is it an objection of any weight against
this, that we cannot comprehend how this work can be wrought
in infants. For neither can we comprehend how it is wrought in
a person of riper years.”<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is no part of our task either to justify or condemn these
opinions; but, perhaps, the following extract from an article, probably
written by Samuel Wesley, and inserted in the <cite>Athenian
Oracle</cite>, (vol. i., p. 457,) may with some find more favour, though
there is nothing in it antagonistic to the other opinions of Samuel
Wesley already given.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Baptism is called by the apostle ‘the laver of regeneration,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and accordingly our Church, not only lawfully, but commendably,
uses the word regeneration for baptism; and, in the offices for that
sacrament, more than once mentions the child’s being regenerate,
which it explains by its being grafted into the body of Christ’s
Church, and so admitted into the communion of saints. Children
have then a federal holiness as children of believing parents; and,
as the first-born among the Jews were dedicate, devoted, or holy in
the Lord, so in that sense children of believing parents are holy—in
that sense they are regenerate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a remarkable fact, not generally known, that John Wesley’s
“Treatise on Baptism,” published in the tenth volume of his collected
works, and dated November 11, 1756, is nothing less or
more than his father’s “Short Discourse of Baptism,” published
fifty-six years before. It is true that the son has very <em>slightly</em>
abridged and verbally altered his father’s essay, but that is all.
He thus makes all the opinions of his father, on baptism, his own;
but it is somewhat strange that he should republish the treatise
without the least reference to its original author. It is hardly
fair that the treatise should be published as his own. In more
respects than one, John Wesley was a courageous man.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same year in which Samuel Wesley published his “Pious
Communicant,” he also gave to the public a poem, entitled, “An
Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry, by Samuel Wesley. London:
Printed for Charles Harper, 1700.” The poem is a folio of
thirty pages, and consists of 1083 lines.</p>

<p class='c001'>The preface is an earnest—almost furious—production, stating
his design, and dwelling on the strong tendency to infidel principles
evinced by some of the chief literary men then living. He
writes:—“The direct design of a great part of this poem is to
serve the cause of religion and virtue. My quarrel is with those
that rank themselves among atheists, and impudently defend and
propagate the ridiculous opinion of the eternity of the world, and
of that fatal, invincible chain of things which is now made use of
to destroy the faith, as our lewd plays are to corrupt the morals,
of the nation;—an opinion big with more absurdities than transubstantiation
itself, and of far more fatal consequences. Besides
weakening, if not destroying, the belief of the being and providence
of God, it utterly takes away freedom in human actions,
reduces mankind beneath the brute creation, perfectly excuses the
greatest villainies, and entirely vacates all retribution hereafter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>One would wonder with what face or conscience such a set of men
should hope to be treated by the rules of civility, when they themselves
break through those of common humanity. How can they
expect any fairer quarter than wolves or tigers; or, what reason
can they give why a price should not be set upon their heads as
well as on the others; or, at least, why they should not be securely
hampered and muzzled, and led about for a sight like other
monsters? It is the fatal and spreading poison of these men’s
principles and example which has extorted these warm expressions
from me. I cannot with patience see my country ruined by the
prodigious increase of infidelity and immorality, nor forbear
crying out, with some vehemence, when it is in greater and more
imminent danger than it would have been formerly if the Spanish
Armada had made a descent among us. If things go on as they
now are, we are in a fair way to become a nation of atheists. It
is now no difficult matter to meet with those who pretend to be
lewd on principle. They attack religion in form, and batter it
from every quarter; they would turn the very Scriptures against
themselves, and labour hard to remove a Supreme Being out of
the world; or, if they do vouchsafe Him any room in it, it is
only that they may find fault with His works, which they think,
with that blasphemer of old, might have been much better ordered
had they themselves stood by and directed the architect.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What would these men have? Why cannot they be content
to sink single into the bottomless pit without dragging so much
company with them? Can they grapple with Omnipotence? Can
they thunder with a voice like God, and cast abroad the rage of
their wrath? Could they annihilate hell they might be tolerably
happy, more quietly rake through the world, and sink into
nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is too great reason to apprehend that this infection is
spread among persons of almost all ranks, though some may think
it decent still to keep on a religious masque. This is hypocrisy
with a witness, the basest and meanest of vices. The cowards
will not believe a God, because they dare not; for woe be to them
if there be one, and consequently any future punishment! From
such as these I desire no favour, but that of their ill word; as
their crimes must expect none from me. If I could be ambitious
of a name in the world, it should be that I might sacrifice it in so
glorious a cause as that of religion and virtue. If none but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>generals must fight in this sacred war, when there are such infernal
hosts on the other side, they could never prevail without
one of the ancient miracles. If little people can but discharge
the place of a private sentinel, it is all that is expected from us.
I hope I shall never let the enemies of God and my country come
on without firing, though it serve but to give the alarm; and, if
I die without quitting my post, I desire no greater glory. I have
no personal pique against any whose characters I may have given
in this poem, nor think the worse of them for their thoughts of
me. I hope I have everywhere done them justice, and have given
them commendation where they merit it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is strong language respecting the chief writers of the day;
but it was not unneeded. It is true, that, there were honourable
exceptions—such as Addison, who was now enjoying his pension
of £300 a year for his complimentary poem on one of the campaigns
of King William; Sir Richard Steele, who was writing
his “Christian Hero;” Dean Swift, who, having published his
poetical essays, was now pondering his “Tale of a Tub;” Pope,
who, as a boy twelve years old, was writing, in Windsor Forest,
his “Ode on Solitude;” Parnell, who was just made M.A., and
ordained a deacon; and Edward Young, who was now completing
the first part of his education at Winchester. Of these and
others we say nothing; but contemporaneous with them were
William Wycherley, who attacked vice, it is true, but attacked it
with the severity of a cynic, and the language of a libertine;
Matthew Prior, who, notwithstanding his poetic fame, cohabited
with a despicable drab of the lowest kind; William Congreve,
“the ultimate effect of whose plays,” says Dr Johnson, “is to
represent pleasure in alliance with vice, and to relax those obligations
by which life ought to be regulated;” Lord Bolingbroke,
whom Johnson designated “a scoundrel, who charged a pop-gun
against Christianity; and a coward, who left half-a-crown to a
beggarly Scotchman (David Mallet) to fire it off;” Anthony
Collins, the infidel, who, notwithstanding his abilities as a writer,
was detected in so many instances of false quotations, and other
unfair modes of controversy, that he must ever be regarded as
one of the most flagrant instances of literary disingenuousness;
Matthew Tindall, some of whose infidel productions were, by a
vote of the House of Commons, ordered to be burned by the
common hangman; John Toland, the “miserable sophist,” as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Swift calls him, whose sceptical writings were ordered to be
burned by the Irish Parliament, and who discussed the mysteries
of Christianity in coffee-houses and other public places, until at
last he wanted a meal of meat, and fell to borrowing a few pence
from any one that would lend to him; and John Dryden, with
his sometimes Popish, and sometimes latitudinarian creed—a man
of splendid talents, but whose writings, while flashing with the
highest genius, are often soaked and loathsome with the foulest
vice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Macaulay, in reference to a period a few years earlier, writes:—“The
profligacy of the English plays, satires, songs, and novels
of that age is a deep blot on our national fame. The evil may
easily be traced to its source. The wits and the Puritans had
never been on friendly terms. From the Reformation to the civil
war, almost every writer had taken some opportunity of assailing
the straight-haired, snuffling, whining saints, who christened their
children out of the Book of Nehemiah, who groaned in the spirit
at the sight of Jack in the Green, and who thought it impious to
taste plum-porridge on Christmas-day. At length a time came
when the laughers began to look grave in their turn. The rigid,
ungainly zealots, after having furnished much good sport during
two generations, rose up in arms, conquered, ruled, and, grimly
smiling, trod down under their feet the whole crowd of mockers.
At the Restoration the old fight recommenced, and the war between
wit and Puritanism soon became a war between wit and
morality. Whatever the canting Roundhead had regarded with
reverence was insulted; whatever he had proscribed, was favoured.
As he never opened his mouth except in Scriptural phrase, the
new breed of wits and fine gentlemen never opened theirs without
uttering ribaldry of which a porter would now be ashamed. It is
not strange, therefore, that our polite literature, when it revived
with the old civil and ecclesiastical polity, should have been profoundly
immoral. A few eminent men, who belonged to an
earlier and better age, were exempt from the general contagion.
The verse of Waller still breathed the sentiments which had
animated a more chivalrous generation. Cowley, distinguished as
a loyalist and as a man of letters, raised his voice courageously
against the immorality which disgraced both letters and loyalty.
A mightier poet, tried at once by pain, danger, poverty, obloquy,
and blindness, meditated, undisturbed by the obscene tumult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>which raged all around him, a song so sublime and so holy that
it would not have misbecome the lips of those etherial virtues
whom he saw, with that inner eye which no calamity could darken,
flinging down on the jasper pavement their crowns of amaranth
and gold. But these were men whose minds had been trained in
a world which had passed away. They gave place to a younger
generation of wits; and of that generation, from Dryden down to
D’Urfey, the common characteristic was hard-hearted, shameless,
swaggering licentiousness, at once inelegant and inhuman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s “Epistle concerning Poetry” is ingenious and
able. The editor of Dr Adam Clarke’s Miscellaneous Works observes:
“Such a poem as this may be supposed to have suggested
Lord Byron’s ‘English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.’” We would
add, that perhaps it suggested a much earlier work, the “Dunciad” of
Alexander Pope, which was first published in 1727, twenty-seven
years after the publication of Wesley’s “Epistle.” At all events,
both Pope and Byron would have acted better if, like Samuel
Wesley, they had been guided by justice, instead of being goaded
by spleen, and if their works, like his, had contained more of
criticism and less of spite.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is difficult, without giving extracts, to furnish a just idea
of Mr Wesley’s poem. The following are some of the topics that
are taken up and sketched—viz., Genius, Wit, Judgment, Invention,
Memory, Learning, Conversation, Style, Reading, Measure,
Numbers, Pauses, Quantity, Rhyme, Epic poetry, Tragedy, the
Ode, and Satire. In dwelling on these points, Wesley takes the
opportunity of referring to the most popular writers of poetry to
illustrate his meaning. Chaucer’s lines are so rough and so unequal
in their flow, that to describe their <em>measure</em> is impossible.
Spencer, with his “vast genius” and “noble thoughts,” is a master
of English <em>quantity</em>; but his stanzas are cramped, and his <em>rhymes</em>
affected by antique words. Dryden, with his “matchless skill,”
is highly praised; but, at the same time, Wesley charges him with
having “made vice pleasing, and damnation shine;” and entreats
him, after “sixty years of lewdness,” to repent and seek God’s
forgiveness. Blackmore is eulogised by Wesley, at the time when
all the wits were treating him with ridicule; for few excelled him
in writing poetic fables, and each of his pages is “big with Virgil’s
manly thought.” But, instead of giving quotations descriptive
of men, we give the following, which, to say the least, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>thoughtful and ingenious. The reader will perceive that the lines
are intended to be a description of the human head:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

      <div class='line'>“A cave there is, wherein those nymphs reside,</div>

      <div class='line'>Imperial Reason’s self does not disdain to dwell.</div>
      <div class='line'>With living reed it’s thatch’d and guarded round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, moved by winds, emit a silver sound.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>No sooner was the “Epistle concerning Poetry” out of hand,
than Samuel Wesley devoted himself to a much larger poetic
work, entitled “The History of the Old and New Testament,
attempted in Verse, and adorned with three hundred and thirty
Sculptures. Written by S. Wesley, A.M.; the Cuts done by J.
Sturt. London: Printed for C. Harper.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Clarke says the first edition of this work was published
in 1701; but the earliest edition with which the writer is acquainted
was published in 1704, and is in three volumes, of about
three hundred and fifty pages each. Another edition was published
in 1717, and was dedicated to “the Most Honourable the
Lady Marchioness of Normanby;”—a lady “ennobled by birth,
beauty, and fortune, but more by piety and virtue.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In his preface to the reader, he says: “I have but little to say
concerning this small present which I here make thee. It is some
account of the intervals of my time, which I wish had never been
worse employed. There are some passages here represented which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>are so barren of circumstances, that it was not easy to make them
shine in verse; though they could not be well omitted without
breaking the thread of the history. But there are others where I
have more liberty, wherein it is my own fault if I have not succeeded
better. On the whole, if aught that is here may be useful
to any good Christian, and tend to promote piety, I shall be better
pleased than if I could have composed a book on any other subject
worthy to be dedicated in the Vatican; for I hope I am got on
the right side of the world, and am as indifferent to it as it can be
to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The engravings, or “Sculptures,” as the rector calls them, are
small, but full of genius. John Sturt, the artist, was born in
1658, and died in 1730. He is celebrated principally for the extraordinary
minuteness and beauty of his engraved writing. He
engraved the Lord’s Prayer in the compass of a silver penny, and
an Elegy on Queen Mary in so small a size that it might be set in
a ring or locket. His most curious work, however, is the “Book
of Common Prayer,” which he engraved with marvellous neatness
on one hundred and eighty-eight silver plates, in double columns.
Prefixed is a portrait of King George I., the lines on the king’s
face being made by an inscription of the Lord’s Prayer, the Decalogue,
the Creed, the Prayers for the Royal Family, and the 21st
Psalm, all in writing so minute as scarcely to be read with the aid
of a microscope. This remarkable work was published by subscription
in 1717; and about the same time another of his
productions was similarly issued, “A Companion to the Altar,”
executed in the same ingenious manner. The poor artist, like the
poor rector, was beset with poverty all his days. In his old
age, he was offered an asylum in the Charter-House, but respectfully
declined accepting it. Such was the man who engraved
the “three hundred and thirty sculptures” which adorn and
illustrate Samuel Wesley’s “History of the Old and New Testaments.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This work of Wesley, like his Life of Christ, is permanently
injured by the hastiness in which it was evidently written, and
by the unfinished state of many of its lines; but, at the same
time, it contains scores of passages worthy of Wesley’s great
genius. To enable the reader to form an opinion of the book’s
excellencies and faults, we subjoin a few random extracts, taking
four from the Old Testament and four from the New.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>After describing Moses and his flock at Horeb, Wesley writes:—</p>

      <div class='line'>The largest bush, and fairer than the rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw in harmless flames, and lambent lightnings dress’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though strange, though wondrous strange the sight appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>He to the burning bush approaches near;</div>
      <div class='line'>When from the flames a voice like thunder broke,</div>

have had the good fortune to be read, and therefore to be praised.</p>

<p class='c001'>To say the least, every one must admire the unwearied diligence
of this impoverished man. He had a large and increasing family,
and was £300 in debt; but, instead of sinking under discouragement,
he bravely breasts his trials, and, by eagerly seizing those
scraps of time which devotion to his clerical duties did not require,
he tried to free himself from his distressing embarrassments by
writing and publishing, within two short years, four good-sized
volumes, besides his “Epistle on Poetry,” consisting of nearly
eleven hundred lines.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br />CONVOCATION—1701, ETC.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On three several occasions, Samuel Wesley was elected proctor or
convocation man for the diocese of Lincoln. The first of these
elections took place in 1701; a second in 1711; the date of the
third is doubtful. These three attendances at convocation brought
upon him an expenditure of £150, which he could ill afford to
bear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Convocation is an assembly of the clergy of the Church of
England by their representatives. It is always held during the
session of parliament, and consists of an upper and of a lower
house. In the upper house sit the bishops; in the lower the
inferior clergy, represented by their proctors and others. The
lower house, of which Mr Wesley was a member, consists of
twenty-two deans, fifty-three archdeacons, twenty-four prebendaries,
and forty-four proctors, (being two proctors for the clergy
of each diocese;) altogether one hundred and forty-three persons.
The prolocutor or speaker of the lower house is always chosen by
itself. His duty is to take care that the members of the house
attend its sittings, to collect their debates and votes, and to
convey to the upper house the resolutions which they pass. Convocation
is always called together by the royal writ, directed to
the archbishop of each province, requiring him to summon all
bishops, deans, archdeacons, and others qualified or entitled to sit
therein. Up to the year 1605, it was the privilege of convocation
to fix the taxes which should be paid by the clergy; but, at that
time, this privilege was surrendered to the House of Commons,
on the condition that henceforth, and in lieu of it, the clergy
should be allowed to vote at elections of members of parliament,
a right of which heretofore they had been deprived. The power
of convocation is limited. Its members are not to make any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>canons or ecclesiastical laws without the royal licence; nor, even
when the royal licence is granted, can any newly-made laws or
canons be put in force except under certain restrictions. They
have the power to examine and to censure all heretical and schismatical
books; but the authors of such books have an appeal to
the king in chancery or to his delegates. It ought also to be
added, that members of convocation have the same privileges
allowed as belong to members of parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, then, was the ecclesiastical parliament of which Samuel
Wesley was elected a member, by his brother clergymen, in the
diocese of Lincoln, in 1701. The honour was distinguished,
though, to a poor man like himself, seriously expensive. Some
writers have not been sparing in the censures they have thought
proper to pronounce on Wesley for spending so much money on
convocation attendance, which, as is alleged, might have been
much better spent in the payment of his debts, or in providing
for the wants of his wife and children. Such censures are soon
uttered, but are scarcely merited. The convocation, which was
called together in 1701, was one of unusual importance, and it
behoved the clergy of the diocese of Lincoln to send as their
proctor the most fitting man that the diocese contained; and that
man, being elected, was bound by every principle of duty and of
honour to take upon himself the onerous responsibility of representing
the gentlemen who had thus distinguished him. The
expenses of the office might be inconvenient, yet to be selected
as a fitting representative to the most august and important
ecclesiastical assembly in the land, was an honour not to be
despised. Many a minister struggling with poverty would have
readily made as great a sacrifice to have attained as high a dignity,
especially if its attainment was likely to be the stepping-stone to
yet higher ecclesiastical power and benefit. Samuel Wesley’s
talents, learning, piety, and literary works were sufficient to justify
him in aspiring after the higher, if not highest offices that the
Church has to give; and it is not improbable that had it not been
for his pecuniary embarrassments, and his cruel imprisonment in
Lincoln gaol, he would have died, not the rector of an almost unknown
country parish, but in one of the most distinguished positions
to which a clergyman of the Church of England can be exalted.
Apart from a sense of the honour which his brethren had bestowed
upon him, and apart from his readiness to undertake difficult and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>expensive duties, it is no disparagement of Samuel Wesley’s unblemished
character to say, that perhaps he had some hope of such
promotion when he consented, at such an inconvenient sacrifice,
to go as proctor to the house of convocation. Considering his
talents, attainments, and labours, such ambition was neither
mercenary nor inordinate. The clergy of the diocese of Lincoln
conferred an honour upon the Epworth rector in thus electing
him; but the honour was merited, and it would have been not
only an act of kindness, but an act of justice, if those who gave
the honour had also given the money which it cost to wear it.</p>

<p class='c001'>A remarkable anecdote is related in connexion with Mr Wesley’s
first attendance at convocation. Dr A. Clarke, who gives it, says
he had it from the lips of Mr Wesley’s son John. The statement
is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Were I,” said John Wesley, “to write my own life, I should
begin it before I was born, merely for the purpose of mentioning
a disagreement between my father and mother. ‘Sukey,’ said
my father to my mother one day after family prayer, ‘why did
you not say <em>amen</em> this morning to the prayer for the king?’
‘Because,’ said she, ‘I do not believe the Prince of Orange to be
king.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said he, ‘you and I must part; for
if we have two kings, we must have two beds.’ My mother was
inflexible. My father went immediately to his study; and, after
spending some time with himself, set out for London, where, being
<em>convocation man</em> for the diocese of Lincoln, he remained without
visiting his own house for the remainder of the year. On March
8th, in the following year, 1702, King William died; and as both
my father and mother were agreed as to the legitimacy of Queen
Anne’s title, the cause of their misunderstanding ceased. My father
returned to Epworth, and conjugal harmony was restored.”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley’s own written account of this affair is the following:—“The year
before King William died, my father observed
my mother did not say amen to the prayer for the king. She said
she could not, for she did not believe the Prince of Orange was
king. He vowed he would never cohabit with her till she did.
He then took his horse and rode away; nor did she hear anything
of him for a twelvemonth. He then came back and lived with
her as before. But I fear his vow was not forgotten before
God.”<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>There may be the merest modicum of truth in this strange story;
but the greater part of it is unfounded.</p>

<p class='c001'>We grant that Mrs Wesley held the doctrine of the “divine
right of kings;” and holding that, of course, she regarded the
Revolution of 1688 as a royal wrong, and considered William of
Orange a usurper. Of this there can be no doubt. Writing in
the year 1709, she says:—“Whether they did well, in driving a
prince from his hereditary throne, I leave to their own consciences
to determine; though I cannot tell how to think that a king of
England can ever be accountable to his subjects for any maladministrations
or abuse of power; but as he derives his power
from God, so to Him only he must answer for his using it. But
still I make a great difference between those who entered into the
confederacy against their prince, and those who, knowing nothing
of the contrivance, and so consequently not consenting to it, only
submitted to the present government. But whether the praying
for a usurper, and vindicating his usurpations after he has the
throne, be not participating in his sins, is easily determined.”<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With such language before us, there can be no question that
the opinions of Mrs Wesley concerning King William and his
predecessor King James were widely different from those which
her husband held; and it may be easily imagined that such a
difference of opinion might lead to occasional unpleasantness.
No one doubts the truthfulness of the story up to a certain point;
namely, that Mrs Wesley, on a certain morning in 1701, at family
prayer, omitted to say <em>amen</em> to the prayer for King William; that
her husband took her to task for this omission; that sharp words
ensued; and that he immediately set out for London. The one
damaging point which we deny is, that Samuel Wesley allowed a
miserable squabble respecting the rights of King William to make
him neglect his wife, and to leave his house, his family, and his
flock for the space of twelve months; a thing which, if true, would
have been a scandalous, cruel, and wicked act, Fortunately there
is ample evidence to refute such a disgraceful fiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>We maintain, in the first place, that the story is highly improbable.
Samuel and Susannah Wesley became husband and wife
about the time of William and Mary’s accession. Something like
a dozen years had elapsed since then. Every Sunday, and in fact,
every day, Samuel Wesley had been accustomed to pray for King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>William. His wife knew this, and yet all the time they had lived
in love and harmony. Up to this period, there is not the slightest
evidence that any unpleasantness had sprung out of such a
matter. Susannah Wesley loved her husband, and her husband
loved her. “Reverence and love your mother,” wrote her husband
to their son Samuel. “Though I should be jealous of any
other rival in your breast, yet I will not be of her. The more
duty you pay her, and the more frequently and kindly you write
to her, the more you will please your affectionate father.” With
such affection subsisting between them, is it likely that a man
of the high character of Samuel Wesley would permit a paltry
quarrel about King William to lead to such a lengthened connubial
separation, involving not only a cruel neglect of his wife
and family, but a criminal absence from his flock, and a public
disgrace cast upon his hitherto spotless reputation? Those who
can and do believe a legend so unlikely, have more faith than is
desirable.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, in the second place, we further maintain, that the disgraceful
part of this story is not only improbable, but impossible. It
is well known that convocation was summoned twice during the
year 1701. In the first instance, it met on the 10th of February,
and was prorogued on the 24th of June following. It was convened
again on the 31st of December; and, between nine and ten
weeks after, at the death of King William on the 8th of March
1702, it was again prorogued. How then stands the matter in
reference to Samuel Wesley’s long-continued and criminal absence
from his home and from his church? If he attended the convocation
which opened on February 10, <em>it is not true</em> that “he remained
without visiting his own house for the <em>remainder of the
year</em>;” for, on the 14th and 18th of May of that same year, we
find him at Epworth, attending to his wife with affectionate tenderness,
when she was confined of twins; and writing to Archbishop
Sharpe the two letters inserted in our last chapter. If,
again, he attended the convocation which opened on Dec. 31st, all
the time that he was absent from his family and from his parish
was not more than about ten weeks; for, at the expiration of that
time, according to the story itself, “King William died,” and, convocation
being in consequence prorogued, “Wesley returned to
Epworth, and conjugal harmony was restored.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the reader choose which convocation in 1701 he likes, or,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>as we are inclined to do, let him entertain the opinion that Samuel
Wesley attended both, yet, still the evidence above recited, most
triumphantly refutes all that is disgraceful in this cock-and-bull
story; for we have proof that, in neither case, was the rector of
Epworth away from his family and charge for a longer period
than ten or a dozen weeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>We submit that in such an absence there was nothing to justify
such a story. At least, an entire week would be spent in mere
journeying. Then, there were the sittings of convocation, which
we know were unusually important and exciting. Then there
was the fact that Samuel Wesley was a literary man, and had
already, in London, published a large number of literary works—a
fact giving rise to business transactions, which the rector
would doubtless attend to, now that he was personally present.
And then, finally, there was the fact that his brother Matthew
was resident in London, and probably also his mother, besides a
large number of his early and literary friends, with all of whom,
it is natural to suppose, he would wish to spend as much time as
his other duties would permit. Put all these things together, and
what is there to be gaped at in the rector of Epworth, as “<em>convocation
man</em>,” being absent from his family and his church, once,
or even twice, at the beginning of the years 1701 and 1702, for
about ten or a dozen weeks? It is far from our intention to
accuse either John Wesley or Adam Clarke of wilful misrepresentation;
in this respect they are both far above suspicion, but
the tale, as first told to John Wesley, was doubtless told in an exaggerated
form; and it is no disrespect to the wonderful memory
of Adam Clarke to say, that during the thirty or more years which
elapsed between the time when John Wesley told the story and
the time when Adam Clarke published it, the remembrance of the
latter was not so vivid as to be infallible.</p>

<p class='c001'>We begrudge the space which has been filled with this unfortunate
anecdote; but Samuel Wesley is too great and good a
man to permit his character to be injured undeservedly. Let the
full truthfulness of the legend be admitted, and Wesley’s fair
fame is branded. Viewed in such a light, the thing is serious,
and deserves some research and trouble in refuting it. This is
the only matter, in the whole of Mr Wesley’s history, that in the
least affects his morality and honour; and, in our conscience, we
believe that everything in the story, which is deserving of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>censured, is unfounded fiction, and utterly unworthy of the public
credence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley attended convocation thrice. It is certain that
one of these occasions was in 1701, and it is probable that a
second was in the same year; and hence we give a brief account
of the proceedings of both these ecclesiastical gatherings.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the exception of the abortive attempt in 1689, convocation,
though regularly assembling with every parliament, had
literally done nothing for the last nine and thirty years. Now, in
1701, it met to transact business. First of all, on February 10th,
those ecclesiastical legislators assembled in St Paul’s Cathedral,
where a sermon was preached by Dr Haley, Dean of Chichester.
The members of the Lower House then proceeded to the Chapter
House, and elected Dr Hooper, Dean of Canterbury, their prolocutor.
“A man of learning,” says Burnet, “of good conduct,
but reserved, crafty, and ambitious.” They then adopted certain
resolutions as a preparation for the battle which they knew was
coming. 1. That they had a right to sit whenever parliament
sat, and that they could not be legally prorogued but when parliament
was prorogued. 2. That they had no need of licence to
enter upon debates, and to prepare matters. 3. That as parliament
could pass no act without the royal assent, so convocation
could neither enact nor publish a canon without the royal licence.</p>

<p class='c001'>This soon brought them into conflict with their brethren of the
Upper House. On February 25th, an order was brought to them,
signed by the archbishop, proroguing both houses in the usual
form. At the time, the Lower House was holding its session in
the chapel of Henry VIII., and the session was continued in defiance
of the archbishop’s mandate, until, after a short debate, they
adjourned themselves. Then followed a private squabble between
the archbishop and the prolocutor, respecting the prerogatives of
the two houses. This lasted until the 6th of March, when the two
houses met, and agreed upon the form of an address to the king,
thanking him for his pious regard for the reformed churches in
general, and expressing their determination to maintain the royal
supremacy, and the articles and canons of the Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their next session was a fortnight later, on March 20th, when
the prolocutor of the Lower House brought up a representation of
the “pernicious, dangerous, and scandalous” doctrines contained
in Toland’s “Christianity not Mysterious,” and requested the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>bishops to agree to their resolutions, and to censure the book. This
was another cause of jangling. Burnet says:—“This struck directly
at Episcopal authority. It seemed strange to see men who
had so long asserted the divine right of Episcopacy, and that
presbyters were only their assistants and council, now assume to
themselves the most important act of church government, the
judging in points of doctrine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On March 22d, another book was discussed in the Upper
House, entitled, “Essays on the Balance of Power,” in which it
was asserted that persons had been promoted in the Church who
were remarkable for nothing but enmity to the divinity of Christ.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a>
The bishops, therefore, agreed that a paper should be affixed to the
doors of Westminster Abbey, calling upon the author to make
good his assertion, in order that the parties might be proceeded
against, otherwise the passage in question would be voted a public
scandal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next fortnight was spent in a quarrel between the two
houses respecting the right of the Lower House to prorogue itself,
and they then adjourned from the 8th of April to the 8th of May.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the latter day the houses again assembled. The archbishop
warmly rebuked the Lower House for their unwarrantable assumption
in daring to prorogue themselves, and for claiming a distinct
recess; and declared that such behaviour had “given the greatest
blow to the Church that it received since the Presbyterian assembly
that sat at Westminster in the late times of confusion.” This rebuke
made bad things worse, and the Lower House became more
rebellious than ever. The bishops appointed a committee of five
to meet a similar number of the Lower House, for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>examining the acts of the present synod, and to report upon them.
To this proposal, the Lower House replied that they should not
nominate any committee; but some of its members sent an address
to the archbishop stating their disapproval of its proceedings.
Burnet says:—“Many of the most eminent and learned of
its members protested against its proceedings;” but the actual
protest shows that the opposition, in point of numbers, was a very
insignificant minority, consisting, at the most, of only fifteen
persons.</p>

<p class='c001'>To evince their opposition still more, the Lower House proceeded
to attack the work of Burnet on the Thirty-nine Articles.
This work had been undertaken at the request of Queen Mary,
and was published in 1699, after being revised, corrected, and approved
by three archbishops, Tillotson, Tennison, and Sharpe, and
five bishops, Stillingfleet, Patrick, Lloyd, Williams, and More.
The complaints of the Lower House were three. 1. That Burnet’s
book tends to introduce such a latitude and diversity of opinions,
as the articles were framed to avoid. 2. That there are
many passages in the book which are contrary to the true meaning
of the articles, and to other received doctrines of the Church.
And, 3. That there are some things in the book which are of dangerous
consequence to the Church of England, and which derogate
from the honour of its reformation. For a time, the Upper House
stoutly refused to receive these complaints, because of other irregularities
of which the Lower House had been guilty; but, at
length, at Burnet’s request, they were entertained. A committee
was appointed, and came to the following resolutions:—1.That
the Lower House “had no manner of power judicially to censure
any book.” 2. That it “ought not to have entered on the examination
of a book of any bishop without first acquainting the president
and bishops with it.” 3. That the censure of Burnet’s book
“is defamatory and scandalous.” 4. That Burnet, by his writings,
“had done great service to the Church of England, and
deserves the thanks of convocation.” 5. That the prolocutor and
some other members of the Lower House had been guilty of contempt
and disobedience.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were hard words; but the unseemly squabble was soon
over; for a few days afterwards, on June 24th, the royal writ
prorogued parliament, and, of course, prorogued convocation
with it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>The new convocation was opened on the 31st of December
following. The Latin service was read by the Bishop of Oxford,
and the sermon preached by the Dean of St Paul’s. Dr Woodward
was elected prolocutor, and two months were occupied in
the same angry discussions, respecting the prerogatives of the
two houses, which had disgraced the convocation previous. The
simple point contended for was this: the Lower House claimed
to be on the same footing as to the Upper House that the Commons
in Parliament are in regard to the House of Lords; that is,
to adjourn by their own authority, apart from the Upper House,
where, and to such time, as they should think proper. This the
Upper House resisted, maintaining that the ancient usage was for
the archbishop to adjourn both houses together, and to the same
time. This was the only matter discussed by the convocation
which met on December 31, 1701; and this was not settled,
for, in the midst of the discussion, King William died on the
8th of March 1702, and thus those ecclesiastical brawlers were
sent home to attend to more sacred work in their respective
churches.</p>

<p class='c001'>These disreputable contentions continued for many years after
this. “The governing men in the Lower House,” says Burnet,
“were headstrong and factious, and designed to force themselves
into preferment by the noise they made, and by the ill-humour
which they endeavoured to spread among the clergy, who were
generally soured by their proceedings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to say what part Samuel Wesley took in these
convocation debates; and, in the absence of information, the
reader is left to guess.</p>

<p class='c001'>We conclude the present chapter with a brief review of the
state of things during the reign of King William’s successor,
Queen Anne. This will clear the way for further details respecting
Mr Wesley.</p>

<p class='c001'>Anne was proclaimed Queen of England in March 1702. She
was in the thirty-eighth year of her age, but was as much under
the tutelage of Lord and Lady Marlborough as if she had been a
girl of fifteen, or of still tenderer years. Three days after her
accession, Marlborough was decorated with the order of the garter,
and very soon obtained the entire command of the English
army. His countess was made groom of the stole and mistress of
the robes, and was intrusted with the management of the privy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>purse. His two daughters were nominated ladies of the bedchamber;
and the father-in-law of one of these ladies, the Earl of
Sunderland, obtained the renewal of a pension of £2000, which
had been granted him by King William. Marlborough’s influence,
in the court of England was omnipotent.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Queen, unlike her predecessor King William, was a most
bigoted Tory. From her infancy she had imbibed unconquerable
prejudices against the Whigs; and looked upon them all not only
as Republicans, who hated the very shadow of regal authority, but
as implacable enemies to the Church of England. Hence she lost
no opportunity of filling up offices of State with her own partisans
and friends, and, in a short time, the Whigs of King William were
displaced, and the Tories of Queen Anne took their posts.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a> All
this had an influence on the nation in general. The people began
to change their sentiments, and persons of all ranks began to argue
in favour of strict hereditary succession, divine right, and non-resistance
to the regal power.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nature,” says Macaulay, “had made Queen Anne a bigot. Such
was the constitution of her mind, that, to the religion of her nursery
she could not but adhere, without examination and without
doubt, till she was laid in her coffin. In the court of her father
she had been deaf to all that could be urged in favour of transubstantiation
and auricular confession. In the court of her
brother she was equally deaf to all that could be urged in favour
of a general union among Protestants. This slowness and obstinacy
made her important. It was a great thing to be the only
member of the Royal family who regarded Papists and Presbyterians
with an impartial aversion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon after the Queen’s accession there was a parliamentary
election, and the choice went generally in favour of those who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>friends to the Church and monarchy. The House of Commons
was now ready, as well as her Majesty’s chief ministers, to concur
in her designs for the suppression of Dissenters, and for the
aggrandisement of the Established Church. The House of Lords,
however, had been so remodelled, in the reign of King William,
that there was only a minority of its members in favour of the
Queen’s principles and projects, and hence ecclesiastical measures,
which passed the Lower House with acclamations, met in the Upper
House with opposition and defeat.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the first measures of the new parliament was the
“Occasional Conformity Bill,” the real object of which was to
render null the Toleration Act, by providing that all who took the
sacrament and the test, as qualifications for office, and afterwards
went to the meetings of Dissenters, should be disabled for holding
public offices, and should be fined £100, and £5 additional for
every day that such person or persons continued in public office
after being present at such Dissenting meetings. The Queen’s
Tories in the House of Commons carried the bill with a triumphant
majority; but, in the House of Lords, King William’s bishops
stoutly opposed the measure, and, despite the influence of Marlborough,
succeeded in its rejection. When parliament broke up,
the Queen told its members that she hoped such of her subjects
as had “the <em>misfortune</em> to dissent from the Church of England
would rest secure and satisfied in the Act of Toleration, which she
was firmly resolved to maintain;” and that those who had the
“happiness and advantage to be of <em>our Church</em> might rest assured
that she would make it her particular care to encourage and
maintain the Church in all its just rights and privileges, and so
transmit it securely settled to posterity.”<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When parliament re-assembled, in 1703, the rejected “Occasional
Conformity Bill” was again brought into the House of Commons,
and passed without any considerable opposition, but was again
rejected in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same year, the Queen, on her birthday, showed her
devoted attachment to the Church of England by making a grant
of her whole revenue, arising out of the first-fruits and tenths, for
augmenting the livings of the poorer clergy. These first-fruits
and tenths amounted to about £16,000 a year, and, in the time of
Charles II. had been distributed chiefly among his concubines and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>his illegitimate children. There were now hundreds of clergymen
whose livings were not worth more than £20 a year, and
thousands whose livings did not exceed £50 a year. Of course,
the Queen was well nigh overwhelmed with addresses, thanking
her for her royal bounty, and it was difficult to tell whether she
was prouder of the title “Queen of England,” than she was of
“Nursing-mother to the Church.” This tender care for poor
ministers, however, did not extend to other sects of the Protestant
communion; for, just at the same time, this royal benefactress
allowed the Irish Parliament to stop the paltry grant of £1200
per annum, which had been paid to the poor Presbyterian ministers
in Ulster in the reign of her predecessor, King William.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1704, the “Occasional Conformity Bill” was a third time
introduced into the House of Commons, though there was
still not the slightest chance of its passing in the House of
Lords.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the year following, Lord Halifax moved, in the Upper House,
that a day might be appointed to inquire into the “Dangers of
the Church,” it being alleged that the rejection of the “Occasional
Conformity Bill” was likely to ruin both Church and State, and
especially when this was coupled with the liberty of the press and
the licence of the times, wherein no restraint was laid upon those
who vilified the established religion. Both Houses of Parliament,
however, passed a resolution, to the effect, that the Church of
England was in a most safe and flourishing condition, and the
Queen ordered a proclamation to be issued accordingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this created great excitement, which will have to be more
fully noticed in another chapter. At present, we can only add
that, in 1712, an act was passed by parliament, to the effect, that,
if any person holding public office should attend a conventicle, at
which more than ten persons were assembled, he should be fined
£40, and should be adjudged incapable henceforth to hold such
office, or any other office or employment whatsoever, unless he
conformed to the Church of England for one year without being
present at any conventicle, and received, during that year, the
holy sacrament at least three times.</p>

<p class='c001'>This intolerant Act of Parliament was followed by another of a
kindred kind, in 1714, the year of Queen Anne’s decease—“An
Act to prevent the growth of schism, and for the further security of
the Churches of England and Ireland, as by law established.” By
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>this statute, it was enacted that, if any person dared to keep any
public or private school without subscribing a declaration to the
effect that he would conform to the Liturgy of the Church of
England, and without obtaining a licence from the ordinary of the
place, such person, on conviction, should be committed to the
common gaol for three months. The same penalty was to be
inflicted upon a person who had duly qualified himself for the
office of schoolmaster, and had obtained the necessary licence, if
he dared to be present at any conventicle where prayer was not
offered for Queen Anne.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This was a fitting wind up of the reign of an ecclesiastical,
though well-intentioned bigot. Anne was seized with apoplexy
on the 28th of July 1714, and four days afterwards died, without
being able either to receive the sacrament or to sign her will.
This princess was remarkable neither for learning nor capacity,
and yet “she was,” says John Wesley, “a good wife, a tender
mother, a warm friend, an indulgent mistress, a munificent
patron, and a merciful monarch; for, during her whole reign, no
subjects’ blood was shed for treason. In a word, if she was not
the greatest she was certainly one of the best and most unblemished
sovereigns that ever sat upon the throne of England; and well
deserved the expressive, though simple, epithet of ‘The good
Queen Anne.’”<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Great efforts were made, during the reign of Anne, to multiply
churches, but, at the same time, there was an enormous increase
of places of public resort and public discussion. Club-houses,
chocolate-houses, and coffee-houses became so numerous that,
besides the large ones, there was one or more for almost every parish
in the capital, in which citizens regaled themselves to their hearts’
content, and found fault with the management of public matters.
On entering a coffee-house, the visitor had only to pay a penny at
the bar, and for this he was not only served with a cup of coffee,
but accommodated with the newspapers of the day, and with the
newest pamphlets on morals and on politics. Tradesmen forsook
their shops, and merchants their offices, to take care of the affairs
of state, and to harangue upon the misconduct of the ministry,
until, by neglecting their business, those oratorical financiers and
disinterested patriots were, not unfrequently, seized by an ambushment
of bumbailiffs, and, after having defrayed the debts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the nation, were ignominiously conducted to a sponging-house for
not being able to pay their own.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the middle and the lower classes were thus discussing
politics, the fashionable orders were devoted to pleasure and to
gallantry. From ten to twelve the beau received his visitors in bed,
where he lay in state, his periwig, superbly powdered, lying beside
him on the sheets; while his toilet-table was sprinkled with amorous
poems, a canister of Spanish snuff, a smelling bottle, and a
few fashionable trinkets. At twelve he rose, and after spending
three hours in perfuming his clothes, in soaking his hands in washes
to make them delicate and white, in tinging his cheeks with carminative
to give them a gentle blush, in dipping his handkerchief
in rose water, and in powdering his linen to banish from it the
smell of soap—the self-indulgent exquisite then sat down to dinner.
At four o’clock, he repaired to some place of public concourse,
where he endeavoured to display his gallantry and wit. At five,
he proceeded to the theatre, where, to give himself the air of a critic,
he readjusted his cravat, and sprinkled his face with snuff. From
the theatre he would wander to the park, buzzing and fluttering
from lady to lady, and chattering to each a jargon made up of
bad English, atrocious French, and undistinguishable Latin. And
then, his lounge in the park being ended, he concluded the day
by dropping into some fashionable party, where he chatted his
empty nothings, played at ombre, and lost his money with an air
of fashionable indifference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides these fashionable beaus, there were those who, in the
language of the day, were called bully-beaus,—fellows figuring in
Ramillies’ perukes, laced hats, black cockades, and scarlet suits;
and who maintained a reputation for courage, by empty swagger
and violent assaults on the peaceable members of society. These
gallants, instead of confining their follies and their fopperies
within the compass of the metropolis, very often made country
excursions to bamboozle fox-hunting squires, and to make love to
their unsophisticated daughters. The fair rustics were dazzled by
the surpassing finery of such manners, dress, and speech; while
young clod-poll squires were set agog to emulate the captivating
visitor. In this way many a youth, whose gayest party had been
a country wake, was translated into a London fop. As soon as
his father had broken his neck over a six-barred gate, or fairly
drunk himself into his coffin, the rustic aspirant turned his back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>on the old mansion of his progenitors, and hied to London, dressed
in his best leathern breeches tied at the knee with red taffeta, his
new blue jacket, and his fashionable greatcoat, both adorned with
buttons of the orthodox size and shape. Bully-beaus and sharpers
took him into training; tailors, silk-mercers, and cabinetmakers
hastened to his levees; whilst prize-fighters, horse-racers, fiddlers,
and dancing-masters, pimps and parasites, soon transformed a
raw country bumpkin into a finished gentleman of town.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the fashionable and bully-beaus, already mentioned, there
were the Darby-Captains, the Tash-Captains, the Cock-and-bottle
Captains, and the Nickers. But of all the turbulent characters
of the period, none were so distinguished as the Mohocks. These
fellows, after drinking to an outrageous extent to qualify themselves
for action, would rush into the streets with drawn swords,
cutting, stabbing, and carbonading all the unlucky persons that
happened to cross their path. Sometimes they “tipped the lion”
on their victim, that is, flattened his nose and gouged out his
eyes; sometimes they were “dancing-masters,” because they made
people cut capers by thrusting swords into their legs; and sometimes
they were “tumblers,” because they would place a woman
topsy-turvy upon her head, or tumble her into an empty barrel,
and send it rolling down Snow Hill. Rightly were they designated
“Mohocks,” for they out-did the atrocities of the tribe of
Indian savages whose name they used.</p>

<p class='c001'>But leaving the male, look for a moment at the female sex. A
fashionable lady in the days of Queen Anne was thought to be
learned enough if she could barely read and write. If she could
finish a letter without notorious bad spelling, she might pass for
a wit. She plunged into all the amusements of the day with an
intensity proportioned to her lack of moral and intellectual
resources. A whirl of daily varieties was necessary to occupy
the emptiness of her mind. She dashed over the town, upon a
round of visiting, in a carriage with four laced and powdered
footmen behind it. When she was obliged to stay at home, she
regaled herself with frequent libations of tea, sometimes qualified
with brandy. When her female friends dropped in, the scandal
of the day commenced, and reputations were torn to tatters.
When she held her levees, the dashing rake and notorious profligate
had free access, and the lewd jest scarcely raised the fan to
a single check. It was unfashionable to be religious; and if a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>lady of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ton</i></span> went to church, it was to see company and to deal
courtesies from her pew. She patronised French milliners, French
hairdressers, and Italian Opera singers. She loved tall footmen
and turbaned negro footboys. She doated upon monkeys, paroquets,
and lap-dogs; was a perfect critic in old China and Indian
trinkets; and could not exist without a raffle or a sale.</p>

<p class='c001'>The manners of high life being thus frivolous and depraved, no
wonder that servants were neither wiser nor better than their
employers. Complaints were universal of the arrogance, dishonesty,
laziness, and luxury of valets and footmen; whilst charges
against pert, mercenary, intriguing Abigails were equally loud and
numerous. Their cleverness, to a great extent, consisted in obtaining
the largest wages for the smallest services.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a condition of the national character was a fruitful soil
for superstition and credulity. Almost every old mansion was still
ghost-haunted, and almost every parish was tormented by a witch.
Fortune-telling was a common and thriving occupation; and
quack-doctors were, if possible, still more numerous than astrologers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The country gentlemen cultivated their paternal acres, watched
with almost Druidical reverence the safety of their ancient oaks, and
were members of the worshipful quorum. On Sundays, they repaired
to the village church, through a lane of uncovered and bowing
peasantry; ascended “the squire’s pew,” the chief seat in the
synagogue, and edified their tenantry by the loudness of their
responses. At Christmas, a multitude of fattened hogs were
slaughtered and distributed among the neighbours; while a string
of black puddings and a pack of cards were sent to every poor
family in the parish. A large portion of these rustic squires were
fox-hunters, and appear, for the most part, to have been as unintellectual
as the horses they galloped, or the animals they chased;
for their proudest exploit was to clear a six-barred gate, and their
highest ambition to secure a dead fox’s brush for the adornment
of their hunting caps.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their wives were quiet, domestic drudges, with scarcely enough
of education to keep their book of household expenses, or to spell
correctly the receipt of a new home-made wine, or of an improved
syllabub. No longer thinking it the great business of life to
embroider cushions and coverlets, they commonly settled down
into the character of a Lady Bountiful, and occupied themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>in supplying the poor of their villages with money, the industrious
with work, the idle with counsel, the vicious with rebuke, and
the sick with medicines and with cordials. In this last department,
many of them became so presumptuous that no ailment
was too hard for them, from a toothache to a pestilence, from the
stroke of a cudgel to that of a thunderbolt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their sons were taught a little Latin and less Greek, beaten
into them, either at one of the public establishments or by the
thwackem of a domestic schoolroom. When they had been whipped
through the parts of speech, interjections and all, and driven
through a few fragmentary portions of the classics, they were then
qualified to shine equally in the senate or at the masquerade. The
grand finish to such an education was the tour of Europe; and
forth went the boy accordingly, in leading strings, to gaze at
streets, mountains, rivers, and trees; and to pick up, in his rambles,
the fashions, frivolities, and vices of the countries through
which he passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their peasantry still presented much the same rude simplicity
which had characterised the poorer classes for the last hundred
years. Rural education had undergone little, if any, improvement;
and the monotonous toils of daily life were enlivened, chiefly,
by wakes and fairs, thronged with puppet-shows, pedlars stalls,
raffling-tables, and drinking-booths.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is a bird’s-eye view of the general state of English society
at the commencement of the eighteenth century.[LY]</p>

<p class='c015'>[The facts in this chapter have been gathered principally from Knight’s <cite>Pictorial

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XIV.</span><br />DISASTERS AND DISSENTERS.—1702–1705.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have already seen that Mr Wesley was seriously involved in
debt. During his attendance at convocation he seems to have
received considerable assistance. In a letter to Archbishop Sharpe,
dated August 7, 1702, he mentions several sums which he had
received from eminent persons: the Dean of Exeter, £10; Dr
Stanley, £10; Archbishop of Canterbury, £10, 10s.; and, he
adds:—“Even my lord Marquis of Normanby, by my good lady’s
solicitations succeeding your Grace’s, did verily and indeed, with
his own hand, give me twenty guineas, and my lady five. With
these and other sums I made up about £60, and came home joyful
enough,—thanked God,—paid as many debts as I could,—quieted
the rest of my creditors,—took the management of my house into
my own hands,—and had ten guineas left to take my harvest.”<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>What is meant by the last sentence but one, I hardly know. It
is difficult to regard it as a reflection on the household management
of his wife. Probably, on account of his wife’s feeble health, his
domestic matters had been managed by his servant; but, be that
as it might, the rector now, perhaps unwisely, took the management
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, however, the current of life was far from flowing smoothly.
Soon after the removal from the miserable hut at South Ormsby
to the spacious parsonage at Epworth, the rector’s barn fell down,
and had to be rebuilt; and now, on July 31st, 1702, another disaster
occurred, which was more serious than the former.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley shall tell his own story in the letter to Archbishop
Sharpe already quoted. He writes:—“On the last of July 1702,
a fire broke out in my house, by some sparks which took hold of
the thatch, and consumed about two-thirds of it before it could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>be quenched. I was at the lower end of the town visiting a sick
person, and went thence to R. Cogan’s. As I was returning, they
brought me the news. I got one of his horses, rode up, and
heard, by the way, that my wife, children, and books were saved;
for which God be praised, as well as for what He has taken.
They were all together in my study, and the fire under them.
When it broke out, Mrs Wesley got two of the children in her
arms, and ran through the smoke and fire; but one of them was
left in the hurry, till the other cried for her, when the neighbours
ran in, and got her out through the fire, as they did my books,
and most of my goods; this very paper among the rest, which I
afterwards found, as I was looking over what was saved.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I find it is some happiness to have been miserable, for my
mind has been so blunted with former misfortunes, that this
scarce made any impression upon me. I shall go on, by God’s
assistance, to take my tithe; and, when that is in, to rebuild my
house, having, at last, crowded my family into what is left, and
not missing many of my goods.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I humbly ask your Grace’s pardon for this long, melancholy
story, and leave to subscribe myself your Grace’s ever obliged and
most humble servant, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>S. Wesley</span>.”</span></p>
<p class='c016'>It is a somewhat singular circumstance that the sheet of paper
on which this letter was written, was one on which he had begun
a letter to the archbishop six days before the fire broke out.
About four square inches of the lower corner of the fly-leaf was
burnt, and the whole was stained by the water that helped to put
out the flames.</p>

<p class='c001'>The good archbishop, to whom this account was sent, came forward
both with his purse and influence; and this produced the
following touching and characteristic letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>March 20, 1703</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—I have heard that all great men have the art of

<p class='c001'>To a man with a large family, and who, if not at present, had
recently been £300 in debt, the burning of his house was a dire
disaster; but, alas! Samuel Wesley’s calamities did not end with
this. During the winter of 1704, which was very shortly after
the rebuilding of his house, another fire broke out, and burnt the
whole of his flax; and, five years after that, a third fire utterly
destroyed his recently re-erected rectory. But these are facts
which, in chronological order, will have to be noticed anon.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the year 1703, a small pamphlet was published, entitled, “A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Letter from a Country Divine to his Friend in London, concerning
the Education of Dissenters in their Private Academies in
several parts of this Nation: Humbly offered to the consideration
of the Grand Committee of Parliament for Religion, now sitting.
London, 1703,” 4to., pp. 15.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c014'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Samuel Wesley was the writer of
this letter; but it was printed without either his consent or knowledge;
and, as it led to a serious, prolonged, and ill-natured controversy,
it behoves us to examine its history.</p>

<p class='c001'>Up to the time that Mr Wesley went to Oxford University, he
was a Nonconformist, the child, and the grandchild of expelled
Nonconformist ministers, and a student trained in Nonconformist
academics, and having none but Nonconformist acquaintances.
His life at Oxford was retired, and, therefore, not likely to make
him many friends of another description. On his return to London,
in 1688, he not only kept up a friendship with some of his
old Dissenting associates, but also began to become acquainted
with several gentlemen of the Church of England. One of these,
knowing that Wesley had been educated in a Dissenting academy,
zealously, if not wisely, urged him to write an account of the
inner life of such establishments. For some time Wesley resisted
this request; but at length a circumstance happened which led
him to comply. He tells us that he went, with some of his Dissenting
acquaintances, to a Dissenting festival, held in a house in
Leadenhall Street. The discourse of these festive Dissenters was
so fulsome, profane, and lewd, that he was not able to endure it.
In a little while they sat down to supper, and now they all began
to rail against monarchy, and to blaspheme the memory of King
Charles the martyr. These proceedings convinced Wesley that his
old friends, who some years before had prompted him to “dabble
in rhyming lampoons both on Church and State,” were as disaffected
and disloyal as ever. He felt disgusted, and leaving the
room, he went home, and, before he slept, wrote the letter, which
was published some twelve or thirteen years afterwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here we must pause. The festival, at which Wesley was
present, was the anniversary of the notorious Calves-head Club,
and a brief account of that infamous fraternity seems needful.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>In the British Museum, there is a small quarto pamphlet of
twenty-two pages, entitled “The Secret History of the Calves-head
Club; or, The Republican Unmasked: Wherein is fully shown
the religion of the Calves-head heroes, in their anniversary thanksgiving
songs, on the 30th January, by them called anthems, for
the years 1693 to 1697; now published to demonstrate the restless,
implacable spirit of a certain party still among us, who are
never to be satisfied, till the present establishment in Church and
State is subverted. London: Printed and sold by the booksellers
of London and Westminster, 1703.” From that pamphlet the
following particulars are taken:—</p>

<p class='c001'>The preface states, that, “the poems, or ribaldry, and trash following
were composed and set to music for the use of the Calves-head
Club, which was erected by an impudent set of people, who
have their feasts of calves’ heads, in several parts of the town, on
the 30th of January, in derision of that day, and in defiance of
monarchy; at divers of which meetings the following compositions
were sung, and which, in affront of the Church, were called anthems.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The preface then descants on the persecutions and indignities
suffered by King Charles I., and states that, “of all the indignities
offered to the manes of the injured prince, nothing equals the inhumanity
and profaneness of the Calves-head Club.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It further alleges:—“That Milton and some other creatures of
the commonwealth had instituted this club, in opposition to Bishop
Juxon, Dr Sanderson, Dr Hammond, and other divines of the
Church of England, who met privately every 30th of January,
and, though it was during the time of the usurpation, compiled a
private form of service for the day, not much different from what
we now find in the Liturgy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is stated further, that “after the Restoration, the eyes of the
Government being upon the whole (Calves-head) party, they were
obliged to meet with a great deal of precaution; but now, in the
second year of the reign of King William, they meet almost in a
public manner, and apprehend nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A gentleman, about eight years ago, went out of mere curiosity
to see their club, which was kept at no fixed house, but removed
as they saw convenient. The place they met in, when he
was with them, was in a blind alley about Moorfields; and the
company wholly consisted of Independents and Anabaptists. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>famous Jerry White, formerly chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, who,
no doubt, came to sanctify with his pious exhortations the ribaldry
of the day, said grace. After the table-cloth was removed, the
anniversary anthem, as they impiously called it, was sung, and a
calf’s head filled with wine, or other liquor, was placed before the
company. Then a brimmer went about to the pious memory of
those worthy patriots that had killed the tyrant, and had delivered
the country from his arbitrary sway; and, last of all, a collection
was made for the mercenary scribbler, who had composed the
anthem, to which every man contributed according to his zeal for
the cause, or the ability of his purse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such are the principal statements contained in the edition of
this curious and scarce pamphlet, published in 1703; but, in another
edition, published two years afterwards, it is added: “That
an axe was hung up in the club room; and that the bill of fare
was a large dish of calves’-heads dressed in divers ways, a large
pike with a small one in his mouth as an emblem of tyranny, a
large cod’s head to represent the person of the king, and a boar’s
head with an apple in its mouth to represent the king’s bestiality.
After the repast, one of the elders of the club presented an Eikon
Basilike, which, with great solemnity, was burnt upon the table
whilst the anthem was being sung; and then another elder produced
Milton’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Defensio Populi Anglicani,’</span> upon which all laid
their hands, and made a protestation, in form of an oath, for ever
to stand by and to maintain it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The anthems for the years 1693 to 1697, inclusive, are then
given in the pamphlet, and contain some things which it would be
criminal to reprint. We subjoin the least objectionable specimens
that we can give.</p>

<p class='c001'>The anthem for 1693 consists of five verses of eight lines each,
with a chorus. The following lines are taken from the third and
fourth verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Triumphant laurels too must crown that head,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose righteous hand struck England’s tyrant dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>The heroes too, adorn’d with blood and sweat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who forced the opposing monster to retreat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis force must pull the lawless tyrant down;</div>
      <div class='line'>But give men knowledge, and the priest’s undone;</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain he whines, in vain he cants and prays,</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s not a man believes one word he says.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>The following infamous lines are taken from the anthem for
1694. After describing the “fall of the tyrant,” and the satisfaction
of the nation, and their own celebration of the event, those
bacchanalian revellers are made to sing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then fill the calf’s cranium to a health so divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cause, the old cause, shall ennoble our wine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Charge briskly around, fill it up, fill it full,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis the last and best service of a tyrannical skull.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Then to puss, boys, to puss, boys,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Let’s drink it off thus, boys,” &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The anthem for 1695 consists of five verses; the first, the second,
and the fourth verses are too profane and lewd to be reproduced.
The following are the third and fifth. After describing the people
hurrying to Church on the 30th of January, and asking what is
meant by it, the foul-mouthed members sing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! sir, it is a debt they say,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mother Church must yearly pay</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To her saints’ canonisation;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is the day in which he fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>A martyr to the cause of hell,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Justly crown’d with decollation.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“May the banish’d Tarquins’<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a> fate,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Some mean shameful death attend him:</div>
      <div class='line'>May cursed Lewis, for old sores,</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn him poorly out of doors;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then may some friendly halter end him.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The greater part of the anthem for 1696 is filthy and profane
to a horrible degree. The following are the last four lines, and
the least exceptionable:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! how should we rejoice and pray, and never cease to sing a,</div>
      <div class='line'>If bishops too were chased away, and banish’d with their king a,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then peace and plenty would ensue, our bellies would be full a,</div>
      <div class='line'>The enliven’d isle would laugh and smile, as in the days of Noll a.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The anthem for 1697 consists of ten verses. The following are
the eighth and ninth:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They and we this day observing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Differ only in one thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>They are canting, whining, starving,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We, rejoicing, drink and sing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Advance the emblem of the action!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fill the calf’s skull full of wine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Drinking ne’er was counted faction,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Men and gods adore the vine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is said that the author of these scurrilous productions was
Benjamin Bridgewater, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge,
“whose genius,” says Dunton, “was very rich, and ran much upon
poetry; but, alas! wine and love were his ruin.” He was largely rewarded
by the Calves-head Club for his profane and lewd effusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Assuming the above description of the Calves-head Club to be
correct, no wonder that Samuel Wesley was disgusted with its
proceedings; and, though this perhaps scarcely justifies the writing
of the letter which was published in 1703, yet, it is some excuse
for it. Wesley, in his letter, apologises for writing against a
body among whom he was educated, to whom his ancestors belonged,
and from whom he had received many personal favours.
He declares that he feels no enmity against the party he had left;
that he honoured some of them, and pitied others, but hated none.
He states that his purpose is to relate the methods used by Dissenters
to propagate a ministry in opposition to the Established
Church; to describe what kind of schools and colleges they had
set up, to supersede the necessity of going to the universities; and
to show how these were maintained, what principles they taught,
and what sort of arguments they used to confirm their pupils in their
dissent, and to hinder them from going over to the communion of
the Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>But now, it may be asked, why was Wesley’s letter, after the
lapse of so many years, given to the public in a printed form? It
is somewhat difficult to answer this; and yet there are certain
facts which will help to cast light upon it. In 1702, King William
died, and Queen Anne, the patroness of the High Church
party, succeeded to the throne. The Dissenters, who, for the last
thirteen years, had received royal favours, were now the objects of
royal abhorrence. Just at this juncture, Samuel Wesley’s letter
respecting their academies was published. In the same year,
1703, the first part of Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion was
printed, and dedicated to Queen Anne. In the dedication occurs
the following paragraph:—“What can be the meaning of the
several seminaries, and, as it were, universities, set up in divers
parts of the kingdom, by more than ordinary industry, contrary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>law, supported by large contributions, where the youth is bred
up in principles directly contrary to monarchical and Episcopal
government? What can be the meaning of the constant solemnizing
by some men, the anniversary of that dismal thirtieth of
January, in scandalous and opprobrious feasting and jesting,
which the law of the land hath commanded to be perpetually
observed in fasting and humiliation? It is humbly submitted to
your Majesty whether this does not look like an industrious propagation
of the rebellious principles of the last age, and whether
it is not necessary that your Majesty should have an eye toward
such unaccountable proceedings?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1704, a second part of Clarendon’s History was published,
with another dedication to the same royal patroness, in which, in
reference to the Dissenters, it is said:—“Let them clear themselves
of that they were lately charged with before your Majesty,
that there are societies of them which celebrate the horrid thirtieth
of January, with an execrable solemnity of scandalous mirth;
and that they have seminaries, and a sort of universities, in England,
maintained by great contributions, where the fiercest doctrines
against monarchical and Episcopal government are taught
and propagated, and where they bear an implacable hatred to
your Majesty’s title, name, and family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same year that Samuel Wesley’s letter was published,
Queen Anne gave her first-fruits and tenths for augmenting the
livings of the poorer clergy. In addition to this, the “Occasional
Conformity Bill” was passed by the Commons and rejected by the
Lords, and created great excitement in the nation. In the House
of Peers, “Archbishop Sharpe said he apprehended danger from
the increase of Dissenters, and particularly from the many
academies set up by them, and moved that the judges might be
consulted what laws were in force against such seminaries, and
by what means they might be suppressed.”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It becomes an interesting inquiry to ask in what relation Mr
Wesley’s letter stood to “The Secret History of the Calves-head
Club,” to the strong language used in the dedicatory preface of
Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion, to the bounty of Queen
Anne, to the “Occasional Conformity Bill,” and to the speech of
his faithful and affectionate friend, Archbishop Sharpe? This is
a question which we cannot answer, but that his letter was deemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>an important one is evident from the attention it attracted, and
the excitement it occasioned.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Most of the facts contained in Mr Wesley’s letter have been
already given in the third and fourth chapters of this work, and
hardly anything can be added here.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of Wesley’s most offensive assertions is that the Dissenters
are “a sort of people none of the best-natured in the world,”
though he admits that “all or most of his relations and acquaintances”
belong to that denomination. He adds, that, he was
deterred “writing lest he should be thought ungrateful to those
from whom, for some years, he received his bread; and also, lest
what he said should increase existing animosities.” He says he
“honours some of the Dissenters and pities others, without hating
any.” His statements must have been galling; but we are bound
to say there is no appearance of an acrimonious spirit. Had his
opponents possessed and evinced the same good-tempered moderation,
the controversy would not have been so painful and discreditable
as what it was.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s first and chief antagonist was Samuel Palmer,
an Independent minister of some repute, upon whom Dunton
lavishes the highest praise. He tells us that he was educated by
Dr Kerr, and pursued his studies at the rate of seventeen hours
a-day; that his temper was open and sincere, and that he abhorred
all trick and flattery; that he was a man of great generosity, very
charitable, and very humble; that he never courted the rich, and
was always ready to attend the poor; that he preached without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>notes, and that his delivery, voice, and style were excellent; that
he took great pains with the rising generation, and that his catechetical
lectures were plain, easy, and full; that he was well-beloved
by all the clergy and gentlemen of the Church of England
who knew him, and that he was well skilled in law and politics—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sum all in him that’s good, and learn’d, and great,</div>
      <div class='line'>Place him in learning’s, and in Bates’ seat;</div>
      <div class='line'>He shines in wit, and yet is so sedate,</div>
      <div class='line'>That none can equal, best but imitate.</div>
      <div class='line'>In Palmer see, in Palmer all admire,</div>
      <div class='line'>What nature, books, and honour can inspire.</div>
      <div class='line'>Were Wesley but impartial, he would own</div>
      <div class='line'>His learned answer lash’d him to the bone.</div>
      <div class='line'>A better vindication none could write,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor any satire show us half the wit.”<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Samuel Palmer, as Dunton intimates, pursued his academical
studies under Dr Kerr, a gentleman of considerable reputation for
classical learning, who was first a tutor in Ireland, but was driven
thence by the tyranny of the Earl of Tyrconnel, and then settled
at Bethnal Green, where he met with great encouragement, and
trained several Dissenting ministers, who were ornaments to religion
and learning. Palmer entered upon the ministry at Grave
Lane Chapel, Southwark, in 1698. His first two publications
were his replies to Wesley, published respectively in 1703 and
1705, and which were accounted very able performances, and procured
the author considerable reputation. Within a year or two
after the second of these publications, he, like Wesley, left the Dissenters,
and took orders in the Church of England, and had conferred
upon him the living of Malden in Essex. It is said that this
conversion to the Church of England arose out of his disappointment
at not being rewarded according to his apprehended merit
for his pamphlets against Wesley. It is further said, that, after
he joined the Establishment, he grew lax in his morals until his
conduct became scandalous. We are not informed as to the time
and place of his decease; but, in 1710 he published an octavo
volume, entitled “Moral Essays, founded upon English, Scotch,
and Foreign Proverbs.”<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a> Such was Wesley’s principal antagonist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley’s letter gave the Dissenters great offence, but the
reader must not forget the circumstances under which it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>written, and the dishonourable way in which it was afterwards
published. About the year 1690, Wesley was introduced to the
meeting of the Calves-head Club already mentioned. Rightly
or wrongly, Wesley regarded Charles I. as a “royal martyr,” for
thus he emphatically speaks of him in the dedication he prefixed
to his “History of the Old and New Testaments in Verse;” but,
at the meeting at which he was now present, the name and memory
of Charles were treated with even profane derision and contempt.
Is it surprising that this spirited young man should leave the place
with a feeling of disgust, and that, in the heat of the moment, he
should sit down to write what he had often been solicited to write,
an account of the “Education of the Dissenters in their private
academies”? He tells us that he began to write his letter as soon
as he left the club, and that he finished it before five o’clock next
morning. He then went to bed, placing his manuscript beneath
his pillow. While he slept, a Dissenting friend, who had seen him
thoughtful, came and stealthily took the manuscript away and
read it. Such behaviour was highly dishonourable, and can be
excused only on the ground of supposing that Wesley and this
Dissenter were intimate and confidential friends. Be that as it
may, when Wesley awoke and missed his letter, he charged the
Dissenter with having it. The purloiner produced the missing
manuscript, said he had read it, and that there was nothing in it
but what was true. Still he was doubtful respecting the expediency
of divulging such revelations, and persuaded Wesley not
to send the letter to the person for whom it was intended.</p>

<p class='c001'>That person was Robert Clavel, a respectable and extensive
dealer in books, master of the Company of Stationers, and whom
Dr Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln, used to call “the honest bookseller.”
By some means, Clavel became possessed of Wesley’s letter.
Wesley never intended it for the public eye. He declares
that he wrote it as a “<em>private</em> letter to a particular friend, and
had not the least thought of its being published.” Clavel kept
the letter in his private possession for about a dozen years. The
Dissenters were rapidly rising into power. The High Church party
took alarm, and Queen Anne became a tool for the accomplishment
of their purposes. Just at this juncture Clavel, without Wesley’s
consent, and even without consulting him, took upon himself to
print the letter which Wesley, at a single sitting, had written some
twelve years before, and, to give it more importance, actually dedicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>it to the House of Commons, at that time most hostile to the
Dissenters, and eager to do something for their suppression.</p>

<p class='c001'>What was the result? Wesley’s letter was published anonymously,
but as it contained a biographical sketch of the early history
of the writer, there was no difficulty in detecting the author.
Accordingly there appeared, almost immediately, a small quarto
pamphlet of twenty-four pages, with the following title:—“A
Defence of the Dissenters’ Education in their Private Academies,
in an answer to Mr W——y’s disingenuous and unskilful Reflections
upon ’em; in a Letter to a Noble Lord.—London, 1703.”
This was by Mr Palmer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Palmer’s defence is full of bitterness. He speaks of Wesley’s
“impotent malice,” “trifling stories,” and “unchristian and ungentlemanly
insinuations.” He says that Wesley’s accusation, that
Mr Morton’s pupils vindicated the murder of Charles I., is “scandalous
and false;” that “the Dissenters universally abhor the king-killing
doctrines;” and that they “have not opposed any king,
nor defended any tyrant.” He also denies that the Dissenters were
“undutiful to the Church and injurious to the Universities;” for
“Dr Owen himself required Wesley to go to the University.” He
alleges that Wesley, in his letter, has “acted unbecoming a scholar,
a gentleman, and a Christian;” that he “has betrayed the private
conversations of his best friends, and insulted the works of great
and excellent scholars,” and yet Palmer admits that Wesley’s
“charges might be true, at least in part;” but thinks the things
“were excusable, considering the provocations the Dissenters
received at that period.” He says, Wesley “endeavoured, by artful
and false insinuations, to expose Dissenters to contempt;”
speaks of his letter as “perfidious;” and states that he had
received “many favours from Dissenters even since he conformed
to the Church of England, and that, till the appearance of his
invidious letter, the whole Dissenting party expressed for him, on
all occasions, universal esteem.” He says, Wesley’s works “are
saved from contempt only by the adorable name of Jesus which they
bear, and the lovely memory of that bright saint, the Queen; both
of which names, the best poets think, are injured by his trifling
management.” Much of this is not only abusive, but false.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Palmer’s defence was written at the request of the nobleman
to whom it is addressed; and, besides rude reproaches, contains
an account of the academy in which he himself had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>trained for the Christian ministry. Dr Kerr, his tutor, was “a
great and polite scholar, a curious critic, a penetrating philosopher,
a deep and rational divine, and an accurate historian.” He never
“heard him make one unhandsome reflection on the Church of
England; and he never offered to impose controverted points
upon his pupils. No man living could perform academical readings
better; and his pupils, in proportion to their number, were equal
in learning and virtue to those of any University in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The course adopted by Dr Kerr was for his students to begin
with logic, then proceed to metaphysics, and then to natural
philosophy. They disputed every other day, in Latin, upon the
several philosophical controversies; and, “on Saturdays, all the
superior classes declaimed by turns, four and four, on noble and
useful subjects.” On Mondays and Fridays they read divinity;
and every day, after dinner, they read Greek and Latin authors.
They also went through the Greek Testament once a year. Dr
Kerr began the scholastic exercises of every morning with public
prayer, sometimes in English, and sometimes in Latin. At divinity
lectures the eldest pupils prayed, and those of inferior genius
were allowed forms of prayer, either of their own composing, or
others, as they thought proper. Prayer in the family was most
punctually observed, and nine o’clock at night was the latest hour
for any pupil to be out of doors. Obscene or profane discourse,
if known, would have been punished with expulsion; though
Palmer admits that some of the students broke the rules, and
gives an account of one or two who became rakes, had to leave,
and entered the Established Church. He adds, that the <em>rule</em>
among Dissenters was for every candidate for the ministry to
have five years of preparatory training, and that, before they were
recommended to a pastorship, they had to be examined as to
learning, probity, and virtue, and to have certificates from their
tutors. Such is the substance of Mr Palmer’s defence.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1704, Mr Wesley replied to this. His second pamphlet is
entitled, “A Defence of a Letter concerning the Education of
Dissenters in their Private Academies, with a more full and satisfactory
account of the same, and of their morals and behaviour
towards the Church of England; being an Answer to the Defence
of the Dissenters’ Education. By Samuel Wesley: London, 1704;”
with this remarkable motto—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>The pamphlet consists of sixty-four pages, besides eight of title,
preface, and contents.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his preface, Mr Wesley gives an account of the writing and
publication of his former letter, which he solemnly declares was
printed without his consent or knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>He then states, that, the reason why he now writes this “Defence”
is, because Palmer, by broad inuendos, has charged him
with immoral and scandalous practices while he lived among the
Dissenters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley’s pamphlet chiefly consists of three parts:—1. The
reasons which induced him to write the letter which Clavel had
published, and which had “lost him the good graces of his old
friends.” 2. A consideration of Palmer’s defence of his party. 3.
A refutation of the scandalous charges brought against himself.
The pamphlet is written with great smartness.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1705, Palmer published an answer to Wesley’s second pamphlet,
entitled, “A Vindication of the Learning, Loyalty, Morals,
and most Christian Behaviour of the Dissenters towards the
Church of England; in answer to Mr Wesley’s Defence of his
Letter concerning the Dissenters’ Education in their Private
Academies; and to Mr Sacheverell’s injurious Reflections upon
them. By Samuel Palmer: London, 1705.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Palmer, in his preface, states that in his former pamphlet he
had charged Wesley with giving a perverse and invidious turn to
some of the Dissenters’ innocent actions; with an ungenerous betrayal
of private confidence, by reflecting upon private conversations;
with insulting the works of great and excellent scholars;
and with base ingratitude to his Dissenting friends. He also
speaks most contemptuously of Wesley’s reply to his previous
production, and says he did not think Wesley was “capable of
writing so rash, impertinent, and virulent a piece.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Palmer’s vindication, which consists of 115 closely—printed
quarto pages, is written with great ability, and is divided into nine
chapters. The first is intended to prove that the Dissenters have
a right to have private academies. The second shows that such
academies are no injury to the prerogatives of Queen Anne, and
that their tutors are not guilty of perjury. The third vindicates
the ability of such tutors, and assigns reasons why the Dissenters
have published so few learned works. The fourth gives the
reasons why the Dissenters did not write more against Popery
during the reign of James II. The fifth asserts that the principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and behaviour of the Dissenters are loyal. The sixth defends
the addresses which the Dissenters presented to James II.
The seventh justifies the personal and public behaviour of Dissenters
towards the Church of England. The eighth vindicates
the moral principles and conversation of Dissenters. And the
ninth shows the value which Dissenters place upon external worship,
upon the sacraments, and upon ordination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two years after this, Mr Wesley wrote a long and elaborate
reply to this second pamphlet of Mr Palmer’s; but, for the present,
we must pause in our narrative to glance at other matters now
transpiring. It was a period of intense excitement, and the dissenting
controversy was the great question of the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few weeks after the accession of Queen Anne, the famous
Henry Sacheverell began the war by preaching his furious sermon,
at Oxford, on “political union;” in which, says Defoe, “he dooms
all Dissenters to destruction, without either bell, book, or candle.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c014'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
In this celebrated sermon, Sacheverell lays it down as a principle,
that “religion and government, Church and State, make up one
entire compounded constitution, sharing the same fate and circumstances,
twisted and interwoven into the very being and principles
of each other, both alike jointly assisting and being assisted;
and, like the philosopher’s twins, they communicate to each other
their mirth or sorrow, and equally suffer or rejoice. A ruined
Church and prosperous Government are irreconcilable contradictions
in experience, confronted and confuted by the universal testimony
of all ages and histories, sacred and profane.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a> Having
attempted to illustrate and to establish this principle, he then
makes his doctrine to bear upon English Dissenters, and uses language
the most violent. The following are specimens:—</p>

<p class='c001'>The Dissenters are “a confused swarm of sectarists gathered
about the body of the Church of England, not to partake of its
communion, but to disturb its peace,” (p. 20.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Men like Tillotson, who were in favour of the scheme for comprehending
the Dissenters within the pale of the Established
Church, are designated “false and perfidious members, who, under
the hypocritical disguise of charity and moderation, would
have taken down the fence of the Church of England, and removed
its landmark, to make way for men to enter, who would
have debauched its doctrines, overrun its discipline, and subverted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>its constitution. These shuffling, treacherous latitudinarians ought
to be stigmatised, and treated equally as dangerous enemies to
government, as well as Church,” (p. 20.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Again: “Presbytery and Republicanism go hand in hand.
They are but the same disorderly, levelling principles, in the two
different branches of our state, equally implacable enemies to
monarchy and Episcopacy. They were the same hand that were
guilty both of regicide and sacrilege, that divided the king’s head
and crown, and that made our churches stables and dens of beasts,
as well as thieves,” (p. 20.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, in reference to Tillotson’s comprehension scheme, this
firebrand orator exclaims: “And yet this Church must open her
injured arms to receive this sly and insidious viper into her bosom.
Her sacred enclosures must be laid open, that this boar out of the
wood might waste it. Her partition wall must be broken down,
and the veil of her temple rent in twain, to make way for that
adversary to enter, whom no reason ever yet could convince; no
kindness ever yet could win; no condescension ever yet could
oblige; and whom nothing but the corruption of our doctrine, the
destruction of our discipline, and the sequestration of our estates
and revenues, can satisfy,” (p. 21.)</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Dissenting party have more than once been joined with
the Papists, in their arms and counsels, as well to extirpate our
government as to subvert our Church. They were at first the bastard
spawn of Papists, and have ever since been the instruments
of their malice, the propagators of their schism, and the panders
of that cursed train of mischief, that was originally hatched in a
conclave, and afterwards brought forth and nursed up in a conventicle.
They are not to be looked upon as a religious sect, but
as a political faction in our State, uneasy under its laws, affronting
its authority, denying its legal power, endeavouring to supplant
its jurisdiction, and to wrest the reins of dominion out of
our rulers’ hands,” (p. 22.)</p>

<p class='c001'>The fiery preacher thus concludes:—“It is an amazing contradiction
to our reason, and the greatest scandal upon our Church,
that any, pretending to be her true sons, pillars, and defenders,
should turn such apostates and renegadoes to their oaths and professions,
such false traitors to their trusts and offices as to strike
sail with a party that is such an open and avowed enemy to our
communion, and against whom every man that wishes its welfare
ought to hang out the <em>bloody flag</em> and <em>banner</em> of defiance. Is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>this the people for whom, at the expense of hazarding our eternal
safety, we must give up our ancient faith, constitution, and form
of worship? If the Church of England can have no other way of
showing her charity than by prostituting her purity, and debauching
her religion, I hope they will pardon her if she imitate her
blessed Author and Founder, under a temptation not unlike it,
who, with scorn and disdain, turned His back upon the devil when
he asked Him to fall down and worship him. We must watch
against these crafty, faithless, and insidious persons, who can <em>creep</em>
to our altars, and partake of our sacraments, that they may be
<em>qualified</em> more secretly and powerfully to undermine us. This is
such a religious piece of political hypocrisy as even no heathen
government would have endured; and, blessed be God, there is
now a person on the throne, who so justly weighs the interest of
Church and State as to remove so false an engine that visibly
overturns both,” (p. 24.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the way in which the High Church party <em>began</em> their
campaign, and four months afterwards their representatives, in
the House of Commons, brought in and passed their pet “Occasional
Conformity Bill.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Dissenters, at this period, were an influential and important
community. They were, generally speaking, men of trade and industry,
and the moneyed interests of England were, to a great extent,
in their hands. Such was their consequence in the State,
that, the parliamentary discussions of the “Occasional Conformity
Bill” seriously influenced the money market, and the prices of
stocks rose or fell just as the bill was likely to be passed or to be
rejected.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a> And yet, notwithstanding their number and importance,
they were, with a few exceptions, extremely reasonable in
their demands. Defoe, himself a Dissenter,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> expounds them in
a pamphlet published at the time, and we presume that his exposition
may be considered tolerably correct and just. He suggests
that if Dissenters are to be excluded from all places of profit,
trust, and honour, they ought to be excused from all places attended
with charge, trouble, and loss of time; that if a Dissenter
be pressed as a sailor to fight at sea, or be enlisted as a soldier to
fight on shore, he ought not to be declared incapable of preferment;
and that if Dissenters must not only maintain their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>clergy and their own poor, but also join in maintaining the clergy
and the poor of the Established Church,—if they must pay the
same taxes and the same duties that Churchmen pay, it is somewhat
hard that they are to be treated with so much suspicion as
not to be thought worthy of being trusted to set a drunkard in the
stocks.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Defoe further declares, that, so far as it respects himself, he
has not the least objection to the “Occasional Conformity Bill”
becoming law. He has no notion of “Christians of an amphibious
nature, who have such preposterous consciences that they can
believe one way of worship to be right, and yet serve God another
way themselves. This is a strange thing in Israel! It is like a
ship with her sails set, some back and some full. It is like a
workman that builds with one hand, and pulls down with another.
It is like everything which signifies nothing. To say that a man
can be of two religions is a contradiction, unless there be two
Gods to worship, or he has two souls to save. If it be unlawful
for me to dissent, I ought to conform; but if it be unlawful for
me to conform, I must dissent. To say that you take the sacrament
as a <em>civil act</em> in a church, and as a <em>religious act</em> in a chapel,
is <i>playing bo—peep</i> with God Almighty.”<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the sentiments of Defoe, and he declares that nine—tenths
of the Dissenters, numbering altogether about two millions,
entertained the same opinions.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a> All he asks for is, what the
Queen had recommended to parliament, peace and union. In
such a case, “the concerns of conscience would never make a rupture
in civil society; men would be gentlemen as well as Christians;
they would be Dissenters, and yet not Dissenters; and
there would be conformity in civil ceremonies, though none in
religious. This would make the devil out of love with the English
climate, and the people would get to heaven with the less interruption.”<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Defoe was very far from being one of the mildest and most
moderate of Dissenters; and yet, who can carp at sentiments like
these?</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that blackguards, calling themselves
Dissenters, annually joined in the profane, bacchanalian revelries
of the Calves—head Club; but, on the other hand, it is equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>certain that some of the High Church party, with a direct reference
to the death of King William being said to have been immediately
occasioned by his horse stumbling over a mole—hill, were
accustomed to drink a health to the “little gentleman dressed in
velvet,”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a> and to the horse which so fatally stumbled over the insignificant
heap of earth that had been raised by his <a id='corr286.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='probocis'>proboscis</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_286.6'><ins class='correction' title='probocis'>proboscis</ins></a></span>.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Defoe complains that the same party “endeavoured, by
calumny and reproach, to blacken the Dissenters with crimes of
which they were innocent;”<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> that “railing pamphlets, buffooning
them and dressing them up in the bear’s skin for all the dogs in
the street to bait them,” were published; “and that railing sermons,
exciting the people to hate them,” were preached. He
says “they were threatened with the repeal of the Toleration Act,
blackened with slanders, and bullied with bloody flags, defiances,
and Billingsgate language from the press and from the pulpit;
their meeting houses were represented as houses of sedition, and
they daily suffered from the indignities of harebrained priests,
buffooning poets, and clubs of insolent pamphleteers.”<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>What was the result of all this? The greatest bitterness was
created, and pamphlets, full of scurrility and violence, literally
swarmed. Among the writers of these productions, Daniel Defoe
was the most eminent. The pamphlet which, above all others,
occasioned the greatest commotion, was his “Shortest Way with
Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church.”
This was published anonymously, and pretended to be written by
one of the High Church party, and to set forth their complaints
and wishes. The Church is said to have harboured Dissenters
too long, and to have nourished the viperous brood till they hissed
and flew in the face of the mother that had cherished them. The
Church had been huffed and bullied by the Act of Toleration,
and canting synagogues had been set up at its very doors. The
Dissenters had butchered one king, deposed another, and made a
mock monarch of a third, and yet expected to be employed by the
fourth. If James I. had sent all the Puritans in England away to
the West Indies, the Church of England would have been kept
undivided and entire; but these Puritans, to requite the lenity of
the father, took up arms against the son, put to death God’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>anointed, and set up a sordid impostor who had neither the title
nor the understanding to manage the nation. Coming into power,
they shared the church lands among their soldiers, and turned the
clergy out to starve. During the reign of their own King William,
they had crept into all places of trust and profit, and had
been preferred to the highest posts in England; while, in Scotland,
they had trampled down the sacred orders, suppressed the
Episcopacy, and made an entire conquest of the Church. For
such reasons, they ought to be rooted out from the face of the
land, and never would the nation enjoy uninterrupted union and
tranquillity till their spirit of Whiggism, faction, and schism were
melted down like the old money. It was true, that Queen Anne
had promised them toleration, but she had also promised to protect
and defend the Church; and if she could not effectually do
that without the destruction of the Dissenters, she must, of course,
dispense with one promise in order to fulfil the other. The Parliament,
protected and encouraged by a Church of England queen,
had now the opportunity to suppress the spirit of enthusiasm, and
to free the nation from the vipers that had so long sucked the
blood of their mother. If they were permitted to remain, they
would corrupt posterity, plunder the estates of the members of
the Church, drag their persons to gaols, gibbets, and scaffolds,
and swallow up the Church itself in schism, faction, and enthusiasm.
If one severe law were made and executed, that all found
at a conventicle should be transported, and their preacher be
hanged, they would soon all come to church, and an age would
make all parties one again. Why should an enthusiast be less a
criminal than a Jesuit? Why should the Papist, with his seven
sacraments, be worse than a Quaker, with no sacrament at all?
Why should religious houses be more intolerable than meeting—houses?
What with Popery on the one hand, and schismatics on
the other, the Church of England had been crucified between two
thieves. Now, let the thieves be crucified, and let the foundations
of the Church be established on the destruction of her enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the substance of Defoe’s notorious pamphlet. For a
time, and to some extent, the High Church party believed it to be
a genuine production; and one of them, in a letter, declared that,
next to the Holy Bible and Sacred Comments, it was the most
valuable thing that his library contained, and he earnestly prayed
that God would put it into the heart of Queen Anne to carry its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>proposals into execution.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a> It is certain that there was nothing in
Defoe’s pamphlet but what had been substantially enunciated from
scores of High Church pulpits; but now that it was published,
and a national commotion was created, and especially, as soon as
it was suspected that the writer was not a Churchman, but a despicable
Dissenter, there was a pretence of the most terrible indignation,
and threats of the severest punishment to be inflicted
upon the audacious author.</p>

<p class='c001'>Defoe was suspected, and had to flee for safety. He was
advertised in the <cite>London Gazette</cite>, and £50 was offered by Government
for his apprehension. The advertisement describes him
as “a middle—sized, spare man, about forty years old, of a brown
complexion, and dark—brown coloured hair, but wears a wig; has
a hooked nose, a sharp chin, gray eyes, and a large mole near his
mouth.” This advertisement is dated January 10, 1703, the year
in which Wesley’s letter was published.</p>

<p class='c001'>Six weeks after, the House of Commons passed a resolution,
“That this book (Defoe’s) being full of false and scandalous reflections
on parliament, and tending to promote sedition, be burnt
by the hands of the common hangman in New Palace Yard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Meantime, Defoe was arrested, and, in July 1703, was brought
to trial. His sentence was to pay a fine to the Queen of two hundred
marks; to stand three times in the pillory; to be imprisoned
during the Queen’s pleasure, and to find sureties for his good behaviour
for seven years.</p>

<p class='c001'>In accordance with this sentence, on July 29, Defoe was placed
in the pillory before the Royal Exchange; on July 30, near the
Conduit in Cheapside; and on July 31, at Temple Bar. Such
pillory exhibitions had seldom been witnessed. On each of the
three days, thousands of sympathisers accompanied the condemned
scribe from Newgate prison to his place of shame, to protect him
from hurt or insult, whilst his very pillory was hung with garlands
woven by the fingers of his friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>The pen of Defoe was never plied more busily than while he
was in prison. He wrote more church defiances during his year
of confinement in Newgate than in any other year of his chequered
life. Other persons were equally busy, and in all forms of
pamphlet, tract, and broadsheet, the press poured forth its volumes
of contention. All classes of society seemed to catch the contagion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Dean Swift, in London at the time, declared that the contention
between Church and Dissent was so universal, that the
dogs in the streets took it up, and the cats debated the question
by night on the tops of the houses; yea, the very ladies were so
split asunder into High Church and Low Church, and were so
warm in their disputes, as to have no time to say their prayers.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in the midst of this excitement that Samuel Wesley’s
letter was published by Clavel, and that his controversy with
Palmer took place.</p>

<p class='c001'>But besides having Palmer for an antagonist, Wesley was attacked
by his old schoolfellow, the redoubtable Daniel Defoe.
This was in a pamphlet published in 1704, and which was probably
written in Newgate prison. It was entitled “More Short
Ways with the Dissenters.” The Queen having been obliged to
dismiss her High Church Cabinet, on account of the storm that
had been raised by their attempts to pass the “Occasional Conformity
Bill,” and thereby to suppress the Dissenters, Defoe
alleges that now another scheme was being concocted for the
accomplishment of the self—same purpose. The “new attempt
struck at the root of the Dissenters’ interest. It would effectually
destroy the succession of them in the nation; for it was intended
to prevent them educating their children in their own <a id='corr289.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='opinions'>opinions.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_289.22'><ins class='correction' title='opinions'>opinions.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>He then adds, in reference to Wesley, “If I should say that a
mercenary renegado was hired to expose the private academies of
the Dissenters, as nurseries of rebellious principles, I should say
nothing but what is in too many mouths to remain a secret. The
Reverend Mr Wesley, author of two pamphlets calculated to
blacken our education in the academies of the Dissenters, ingenuously
confesses himself guilty of many crimes in his youth, and is
the willinger to confess them, as he would lay them at the door of
the Dissenters and their schools, among whom he was educated;
though I humbly conceive, it is no more a proof of the immorality
of the Dissenters in their schools <em>that he was a little rakish among
them</em>, or that he found others among them like himself, than the
hanging five students of Cambridge, for robbing on the highway,
should prove that padding is a science taught in that university.
He takes a great deal of pains to prove, that in these academies
were or are taught anti—monarchical principles; but the author
of these sheets happens to be one that was educated under the
same master that he was taught by, viz., Mr Charles Morton of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Newington Green; and I have now by me the manuscripts of
science, the exercises of Mr Morton’s school, and, among the rest,
those of politics in particular; and I must do that learned gentleman’s
memory the justice to affirm, that neither in his system of
politics, government, and discipline, nor in any other of the exercises
of his school, was there anything taught or encouraged that
was antimonarchical, or destructive to the government or constitution
of England. Allow, then, that Mr Wesley fell into ill
company afterwards; allow we had, and still have worse rakes
among us than himself, does this prove that our schools teach
men thus, and that the Dissenters, in general, profess principles
destructive of monarchy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Defoe then proceeds to say, that the reason why Dissenters have
erected and opened private academies, to teach their children by
themselves, is because the Church party, by imposing unreasonable
terms, have shut them out of theirs. He states that, if they will
admit the youth of the Dissenters into their universities, without
imposing upon them unfair oaths and obligations, the Dissenters,
though objecting to “university morals, as to the <em>trifles of drunkenness
and lewdness</em>,” yet, would engage to have always as many
as two thousand of their young people students in these seats of
learning.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remainder of Defoe’s pamphlet is devoted to a violent refutation
of Sacheverell’s second sermon at Oxford; a sermon in which,
he declares, there are fourteen positive untruths, to the reproach of
the preacher’s coat, and the scandal of his ministerial function.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley, in his first reply to Mr Palmer, used the Latin line
as his motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Noli irritare crabones</i></span>. He wished not to irritate the
wasps; but whether he wished it or not, the thing itself was done.
We have seen what Palmer and Defoe say of him and of his unlucky
letter; and, we are bound to add, that others have been not
less pointed and severe. Dunton writes—“Mr Wesley’s first
piece was a most unkind satire. The world had not known him
unless he had thought to make himself public. I am afraid Mr
Wesley’s vein has almost spent itself; the dregs come the last.
His taxing the morals and behaviour of the Dissenting ministers
was a malicious falsehood, published on purpose to carry favour
with the High Flyers, and to enlarge his preferments.” Chadwick,
in his Life of Defoe, broadly asserts that Samuel Wesley
himself published his letter respecting dissenting academies; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that his traducing the Dissenters “was intended, through the
royal patronage, to send this time—serving flatterer into the archbishopric
of Canterbury, upon the back of that unprincipled miscreant,
Dr Sacheverell.” Milner, in his “Life and Times of Dr
Isaac Watts,” observes—“It is difficult to shield Mr Wesley from
the charge of seeking to further the designs of tyranny by private
slander; and of endeavouring to enlarge a scanty income by gratifying
the heads of the Church, in vilifying the seceders from its
communion. There is too much reason to fear that hopes of preferment
led him to join the party of Sacheverell in the work of
abuse and defamation. Mr Southey says, the reason why he left
the Dissenters, was his falling in with bigoted and ferocious men,
who defended the execution of King Charles, and shocked and
disgusted him by their Calves—head Club. The only authority
for this extraordinary assertion is the evidence of Samuel Wesley,
the younger, a violent Jacobite; and Mr Southey introduces the
statement into his pages as if no suspicion was to be entertained
of the truth of the facts it expresses. It may be true that Mr
Wesley was a member of the Calves—head Club; it may be true
that he frequented the blind alley, near Moorfields, on the 30th of
January; but it is not true that any other cause beside his own
imprudence introduced him into such society; it is not true that
the scenes he there witnessed led to his secession from the Dissenters;
for they had no more to do with such disgraceful proceedings
than their accusers; so that, the only inference we can derive
from the representation of Mr Southey is, that the elder Wesley,
in his youth, associated with a band of profligates; and, as extremes
in politics often meet, the furious republican became at
last a blind worshipper of the royal prerogative.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In these extracts, the reader has before him the substance of all
the charges which Dissenting ignorance and hatred have brought
against the character of this venerable man. It is scarce worth
while to refute them; for they are all in flat contradiction to the
facts published in the previous pages of this narrative; and yet,
perhaps, a brief reply may be of service:—</p>

<p class='c001'>We have thus fully stated all the hard things which Mr Wesley’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>enemies have thought fit to say against him, and, in this
summary way, have replied to them. Those who wish for further
refutations must refer again to the pages they have already read.
Defoe’s accusation is calumnious slander of the worst description.
Chadwick is a man whose vulgar ravings are hardly worthy of
being noticed. The life of a man like Dr Watts is blurred and
blotted by such utterly false, if not malignant, charges as those
which the writer has brought against Mr Wesley. We have no
quarrel with Mr Milner on account of his attempt to show that
the Calves-head Club was an infamous association, which the Dissenting
body, as a whole, condemned; but he had no right to impeach
the veracity of Mr Wesley, and, by a mean insinuation, to
try to cast upon him the disgrace of the possibility that he himself
was a member of this godless gang. That is an ungenerous
reproach, which none but an irritated man would have ventured
to employ. The barbarous Calves-head Club was a disgraceful
association, of which the great bulk of the Dissenters totally
disapproved; for it is cheerfully acknowledged that some classes
of the Dissenters were deeply averse to the murder of King
Charles I., and were among the first to welcome his son Charles
II., to the English monarchy; but while all this is most readily
allowed, we submit that this is no refutation of the statement that
the members of that abominable club declared themselves to be
Dissenters; nor is it any excuse for Mr Milner’s attack on Mr
Wesley’s veracity, and especially for his unworthy suggestion that
Mr Wesley himself might be an associate of the profligate fellows
of which the Calves-head Club consisted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Believing Mr Wesley to be unimpeachable in the painful business
that has been here discussed, and feeling that his character
and rank in society make it of some importance to keep his fair
fame without a blot, we offer no apology for this lengthened, and,
perhaps, tedious chapter in his history. Dr Adam Clarke sums
up the whole in terms to which we find it impossible to assent.
He writes: “In the heat of his zeal for the Church, after his conversion
from dissenting principles, Mr Samuel Wesley, in his controversial
writings, often overstepped the bounds of Christian moderation.”
Did he? We have read the whole of his controversial
writings; and, finding no proof of this, we respectfully doubt it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XV.</span><br />THE IMPRISONED FATHER.—1705–1709.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was about this period of Mr Wesley’s history that he wished
and proposed to go as a missionary to the East Indies. The only
English missionary society then existing was the Society for Propagating
the Gospel in Foreign Parts. This society was instituted
by King William III. in 1701, and had for its object the maintenance
of clergymen in the British plantations, colonies, and factories.
It was managed by a board of ninety persons, including
the two archbishops, several bishops, and a number of the nobility,
gentry, and clergy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley’s scheme was threefold. First, he proposed to inquire
into the state of English colonists, in all the English factories
and settlements, from St Helena to India and China; travelling
wherever it was possible to travel, either by land or sea; and
where that could not be done, making the same inquiry by means
of correspondence from Surat, which he seems to have intended
to be his place of residence. He wished to inquire into the number
of the English colonists, their morals, and their ministers;
and to revive among them the spirit of Christianity, by catechising,
by good books, and by other means of the same description.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second part of his scheme had reference to other Churches.
He would endeavour to open a correspondence with the Church
of Abyssinia, or, if the English board of management thought fit,
he would try to pierce into that country himself. He would also
personally inquire into the state of the poor Christians of St
Thomas, who were scattered all over India, and would settle a
correspondence between them and the Church of England. He
also proposed to convey Protestant books among the Roman
Catholics, translated into the language of the countries where he
found them dwelling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, in the third place, he would exert himself to benefit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>heathen natives. He would endeavour to learn the language of
Hindostan, that he might be able to reason and to preach to the
people in their native tongue, and so convert them and their
Brahmins to the religion of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c001'>He acknowledges that he is not “sufficient for the least of
these designs, much less for all together; but it would be well
worth dying for to make some progress in any one of them; and
he would expect the same assistance as to kind, though not to
degree, which was granted of old to the first planters of the
gospel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He thinks that if the East India Company were made acquainted
with his scheme they might deem it worthy of encouragement;
and he also hopes that Queen Anne might be prevailed upon to
grant it her royal favour; but even should the Queen and the
East India Company give him no encouragement, he was still
prepared to go on two conditions—1. That he be allowed £140
a year; £100 of which he would devote to his own expenses,
and the remaining £40 to a curate employed to take his place at
Epworth. And 2. That, in case of his decease while upon his
mission, provision might be made for the subsistence of his family,
they, of course, being supported while he lived by the income of
his rectory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was Samuel Wesley’s noble plan to go as a missionary,
for £100 a year, to St Helena, Abyssinia, India, and China. Perhaps
communications from his wife’s brother, Samuel Annesley,
jun., now resident in India, might have excited within him some
amount of interest in the welfare of the inhabitants of that
country; but, over and above all that, he was animated with a
zeal for God and a love for the souls of men which made him
willing not only to encounter hardship and danger, but even death
in his great missionary project. His father, John Wesley of
Whitchurch, was inspired with the same spirit; and, when forbid
to preach in England, longed to go to Surinam, in Guiana, or to
Maryland, in America, as a missionary among the English settlers
there. The father’s heroic spirit was the spirit of the son, and
also of the grandsons, John and Charles, who, full of zeal for the
Most High, tore themselves from their friends at Oxford, and,
almost without scrip or purse, crossed the Atlantic to preach the
glorious gospel of the blessed God to the different tribes of American
Indians.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Samuel Wesley’s proposal was not adopted; but it was not on
that account the less honourable to his head and heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 5th of April 1705, Queen Anne dissolved by proclamation
the high Tory House of Commons, and, of course, this was
followed by a general election. Whigs and Tories now exerted
themselves to the uttermost. Party struggles throughout the
kingdom were most vehement. The clergy generally were in
favour of the Tories, and took great pains to infuse into the people
tragical apprehensions, that, if the Whigs obtained a majority,
the Church would be in danger. The universities took the same
side of the question, and “the Church in danger” was the election
cry of the Tory party.</p>

<p class='c001'>The contest for the county of Lincoln was extremely violent.
The late members, Sir John Thorold and Mr Dymoke, were Tories.
Their opponents, Colonel Whichcott and Mr Bertie, were Whigs.
Mr Wesley was early and zealously canvassed by both parties.
At first, he promised to do what was exceeding fair, viz., to vote
for Thorold and Whichcott, and thus give to each party the benefit
of his example and of his influence. In course of time, the party-cry
reached the Isle of Axholme. Thorold and Dymoke stood up
for royalty and the Church; Whichcott and Bertie, both Churchmen,
threw themselves into the hands of the Dissenters. By the
Whig party, the Church, the clergy, and “the memory of the
martyr were openly scandalised;” and it now became a serious
question with Mr Wesley whether he should fulfil his promise to
vote for a man whose party were thus assailing the Church he so
much loved; and, though it was “equally against his inclination
and his interest, he determined to drop both when honour and
conscience were concerned, and to vote for the friends of the
Church.” As soon as this was known, the Whigs loaded him and
his family with every kind of insult and persecution within their
power. On the steps of his own church, he was called “rascal
and scoundrel;” but we will permit him to tell his own story.
In a letter to Archbishop Sharpe, dated “Epworth, June 7, 1705,”
he writes:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I went to Lincoln on Tuesday night, May 29th, and the election
began on Wednesday, 30th. A great part of the night our
isle people kept drumming, shouting, and firing of pistols and
guns under the windows where my wife lay, who had been brought
to bed not three weeks before. I had put the child to nurse over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>against my own house; the noise kept his nurse waking till one
or two in the morning. Then they left off; and the nurse being
heavy to sleep, overlaid the child. She waked, and finding it
dead, ran with it to my house almost distracted, and calling my
servants, threw it into their arms. They, as wise as she, ran up
with it to my wife, and, before she was well awake, threw it cold
and dead into hers. She composed herself as well as she could,
and that day got it buried.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A clergyman met me in (Lincoln) Castle yard, and told me to
withdraw, for the isle men intended me a mischief. Another told
me he had heard near twenty of them say, ‘If they got me in the
castle yard they would squeeze my guts out.’ My servant had the
same advice. I went by Gainsborough, and God preserved me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When they knew I was got home they sent the drum and
mob, with guns, &amp;c., as usual, to compliment me till after midnight.
One of them passing by on Friday evening, and seeing
my children in the yard, cried out, ‘O ye devils! we will come
and turn ye all out of doors a begging shortly.’ God convert them
and forgive them!</p>

<p class='c001'>“All this, thank God, does not in the least sink my wife’s
spirits. For my own, I feel them disturbed and disordered; but,
for all that, I am going on with my reply to Palmer, which,
whether I am in prison or out of it, I hope to get finished by the
next session of parliament, for I have now no more regiments to
lose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What had Wesley done to deserve outrages like these? He
had withdrawn his promise to vote for Whichcott, the Dissenters’
candidate, because the Dissenters, for election purposes, began
to abuse the Church, the clergy, and the memory of Charles I.
And, secondly, he had “concerned himself in the election of the
county, which he thought he had as much right to do as any
other freeholder.”<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a> For this claim of freedom to vote as he
thought proper, the professed friends of freedom deemed it
their duty to subject him and his family to all this insult and
injury. Is it surprising that, after this, Samuel Wesley should
look askance upon his old friends, the Dissenters; and that, to
some extent, he should, as <cite>Wesleyan</cite> biographers have stated, ally
himself to the opponents of Dissenters, the “High Flyers” of the
Church of England?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>In the last sentence of the foregoing letter, there is an expression
which must be noticed. Wesley says, “I have no more regiments
to lose.” An explanation will be found in the following
narrative:—</p>

<p class='c001'>For above thirty years, John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough,
had pursued the military life with amazing ability and success.
He had married Sarah Jennings, the companion of Princess Anne.
On the accession of Anne, he was appointed captain-general of the
forces at home and abroad, with an allowance of £10,000 a year.
After a succession of marvellous victories, he fought and won the
battle of Blenheim, in August 1704. In this battle, the French and
Bavarians lost nearly forty thousand men, or about two-thirds of
their entire army. Thirteen thousand were made prisoners, among
whom were twelve hundred officers. Ten French battalions were
wholly cut to pieces; and thirty squadrons of horse and dragoons
were forced into the Danube, most of whom were drowned.
Marlborough took above one hundred cannon, twenty-four mortars,
one hundred and twenty-nine colours, one hundred and seventy-one
standards, seventeen pair of kettle-drums, three thousand six-hundred
tents, thirty-four coaches, three hundred laden mules,
two bridges of boats, fourteen pontoons, and eight casks of silver.
His loss in killed and wounded was twelve thousand. The
hero received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament; the city
entertained him with a splendid feast; the colours taken from
the enemy were paraded from one extremity of London to the
other; the Queen gave to him and to his heirs for ever the manor
of Woodstock and the hundred of Wootton, and caused a palace,
Blenheim House, to be built for him. His prime fault was his
avarice. “The desire of accumulating money,” says John Wesley,
“attended him in all his triumphs, and threw a stain upon his
character. In the whole, he received above £523,000 of the public
money, which he never accounted for, and probably received some
millions by plunder and presents.”<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a> He died in 1722.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the man whose exploits Samuel Wesley celebrated in
1705. His poem is a folio pamphlet of twelve pages, and is
“dedicated to the Right Honourable Master Godolphin.” With one
or two exceptions, perhaps this is the most finished poem that
Samuel Wesley ever wrote. It consists of five hundred and twenty-six
lines, many of them containing beauties of the highest order.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>In consequence of this poem, the Duke of Marlborough made
him chaplain to Colonel Lepelle’s regiment, which was to stay in
England for some time; and a nobleman sent for him to London,
promising to procure him a prebend. All this, however, happened
while he was in the midst of his controversy with Mr
Palmer, and the result was, his old friends, the irritated Dissenters,
who had powerful influence both in parliament and at court,
succeeded in preventing him obtaining the cathedral appointment;
and, also, soon worked him out of the military chaplainship, which
was actually given him.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is to the last of these mean and revengeful actions he refers
when, in the foregoing letter, he remarks “I have no more regiments
to lose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley’s dissenting controversy involved him and his
family in terrible trials. Some have been related, others yet
remain. The following letter to Archbishop Sharpe was written
within a month after the general election:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Lincoln Castle</span>, <i>June 25, 1705</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—Now I am at rest, for I have come to the haven
where I have long expected to be. On Friday last, when I had been
christening a child at Epworth, I was arrested in my churchyard
by one who had been my servant and gathered my tithe last year,
at the suit of one of Mr Whichcott’s relations and zealous friends,
(Mr Pinder,) according to their promise, when they were in the
isle, before the election. The sum was not £30; but it was as
good as five hundred. Now, they knew the burning of my flax,
my London journey, and their throwing me out of my regiment,
had both sunk my credit and exhausted my money. My adversary
was sent to when I was on the road, to meet me, that I might
make some proposals to him. But all his answer was that, ‘I must
immediately pay the whole sum or go to prison.’ Thither I went
with no great concern for myself, and find much more civility
and satisfaction here than in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bevibus gyaris</i></span> of my own Epworth.
I thank God, my wife was pretty well recovered, and was churched
some days before I was taken from her; and I hope she will be
able to look to my family, if they do not turn them out of doors,
as they have often threatened to do. One of my biggest concerns
was my being forced to leave my poor lambs in the midst of so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>many wolves. But the Great Shepherd is able to provide for them,
and to preserve them. My wife bears it with that courage which
becomes her, and which I expected from her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not despair of doing some good here, and it may be, I
shall do more in this new parish than in my old one; for I
have leave to read prayers every morning and afternoon in the
prison, and to preach once a Sunday, which I choose to do in the
afternoon, when there is no sermon at the minster. I am getting
acquainted with my brother gaol-birds as fast as I can, and shall
write to London next post, to the Society for Propagating Christian
Knowledge, who, I hope, will send me some books to distribute
among them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should not write these things from a gaol if I thought your
Grace would believe me ever the less for my being here; where, if
I should lay my bones, I would bless God and pray for your
Grace.—Your Grace’s very obliged and most humble servant,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>S. Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Five days afterwards, the good archbishop wrote a sympathising
letter; but, at the same time, stated what he had heard
against him. This letter Mr Wesley answered; gave a satisfactory
account of all his affairs, and showed that the reports which
had reached the archbishop were perfectly false, and adduced
proof of this. He then continues his letter as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

the burning of a great part of my dwelling-house about two years
since, and all my flax last winter; the fall of my income nearly
one-half, by the low prices of grain; the almost entire failure of
my flax this year, which used to be the better half of my revenue;
together with my numerous family, and the taking this regiment
from me, which I had obtained with so much expense and trouble,—have
at last crushed me, though I struggled as long as I was able.
Yet I hope to rise again, as I have always done when at the
lowest; and I think I cannot be much lower now.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not be in haste to credit what they report of me, for really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>lies are the manufacture of the party; and they have raised so
many against me, and spread them so wide, that I am sometimes
tempted to print my case in my own vindication.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The party whom Wesley had opposed had prevented him obtaining
a prebend, had wrested from him a regimental chaplaincy,
had indirectly occasioned the death of his infant child, had loaded
him with obloquy, and had cast him into prison. Surely this
was punishment enough for the publication of his unlucky letter,
and his two pamphlets in defence of it, and for the vote which he
had given at the general election of <a id='corr302.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1765'>1705</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_302.10'><ins class='correction' title='1765'>1705</ins></a></span>. But not so. Two
months after writing the foregoing letter, be poured fresh sorrows
into the ear of his friend, the archbishop. He writes:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Lincoln Castle</span>, <i>Sept. 12, 1705</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—It is happy for me that your Grace has entertained
no ill opinion of me, and will not alter what you have
entertained without reason. But it is still happier that I serve a
Master who cannot be deceived, and who, I am sure, will never
forsake me. A jail is a paradise in comparison of the life I led
before I came hither. No man has worked truer for bread than
I have done, and few have lived harder, or their families either.
I am grown weary of vindicating myself; not, I thank God, that
my spirits sink, or that I have not right on my side, but because
I have almost a whole world against me; and therefore shall, in
the main, leave my cause to the righteous Judge.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A few weeks ago, in the night, since I came hither, my enemies
stabbed my cows, endeavouring thereby to starve my forlorn
family in my absence; my cows being all dried by it, which was
their chief subsistence; though I hope they had not the power to
kill any of them outright.</p>

<p class='c001'>“After it was done, to divert the cry of the world against them,
they spread a report that my own brawn (boar) did this mischief;
though at first they said my cows ran against a scythe and
wounded themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for the brawn, any impartial jury would bring him in not
guilty, on hearing the evidence. There were three cows all
wounded at the same time, one of them in three places; the biggest
was a flesh wound, not slanting, but directly in towards the
heart, which it only missed by glancing outward on the rib. It
was nine inches deep; whereas the brawn’s tusks were hardly two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>inches long. All conclude that the work was done with a sword,
by the breadth and shape of the orifice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same night the iron latch of my door was twined off, and
the wood hacked in order to shoot back the lock, which nobody
will think was with an intention to rob my family. My house-dog,
who made a huge noise within doors, was sufficiently punished
for his want of politics and moderation; for, the next day
but one, his leg was almost chopped off by an unknown hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not every one that could bear these things: but, I bless
God, my wife is less concerned with suffering them than I am in
the writing, or than I believe your Grace will be in reading them.
She is not what she is represented, any more than I am. I believe
it was this foul beast of a worse-than-Erymanthean boar,
already mentioned, who fired my flax by rubbing his tusks against
the wall; but that was no great matter, since it is now reported
I had but £5 loss.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O my lord! I once more repeat it, that I shall sometime have
a more equal Judge than any in this world.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Most of my friends advise me to leave Epworth, if ever I
should get from hence. I confess I am not of that mind, because
I may yet do good there; and it is like a coward to desert my
post because the enemy fire thick upon me. They have only
wounded me yet, and, I believe, cannot kill me. I hope to be at
home at Christmas. God help my poor family! For myself, I
have but one life, but while that lasts, shall be your Grace’s ever
obliged and most humble servant, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>S. Wesley</span>.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Such were the sufferings inflicted by unrelenting enemies upon
a man with a sickly wife and eight young children. Such conduct
was outrageous, and admits of no excuse. Five days after
the above letter was sent off, the poor prisoner wrote another to
the same excellent archbishop:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Lincoln Castle</span>, <i>Sept. 17, 1705</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—I am so full of God’s mercies that neither my
eyes nor my heart can hold them. When I came hither, my
stock was but little above ten shillings, and my wife’s at home
scarce so much. She soon sent me her rings, because she had
nothing else to relieve me with; but I returned them, and God
soon provided for me. The most of those who have been my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>benefactors keep themselves concealed. But they are all known
to Him who first put it into their hearts to show me so much
kindness; and I beg your Grace to assist me to praise God for it,
and to pray for His blessing upon them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This day I have received a letter from Mr Hoar, that he has
paid £95, which he has received from me. He adds that ‘a very
great man has just sent them £30 more;’ he mentions not his
name, though surely it must be my patron. I find I walk a deal
lighter; and I hope I shall sleep better now that these sums are paid,
which will make almost half my debts. I am a bad beggar, and
worse at returning formal thanks; but I can heartily pray for my
benefactors; and I hope I shall do it while I live, and so long beg
to be esteemed, your Grace’s most obliged, and thankful humble
servant, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Sam. Wesley</span>.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It is uncertain how much longer Mr Wesley was kept in Lincoln
Castle; but four months after this he was once more at his
home at Epworth. Archbishop Sharpe and others were extremely
kind, and the following additional anecdote of his Grace’s thoughtful
sympathy, deserves insertion. Mrs Wesley writes:—“When
my master was in Lincoln Castle, the late Archbishop of York
said to me, ‘Tell me, Mrs Wesley, whether you ever really wanted
bread?’ My lord, said I, I will freely own to your Grace that,
strictly speaking, I never did want bread. But then, I had so
much care to get it before it was ate, and to pay for it after, as
has often made it very unpleasant to me. And I think to have
bread on such terms is the next degree of wretchedness to having
none at all. ‘You are certainly in the right,’ replied his lordship,
who seemed for a while very thoughtful. Next morning he made
me a handsome present; nor did he ever repent having done so.
On the contrary, I have reason to believe it afforded him comfortable
reflections before his death.”<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus wrote Susannah Wesley respecting one of her husband’s
friends. Hear what she says respecting one of his enemies.
“Last Thursday, (May 1706,) a very sad accident happened here.
Robert Darwin, a man of this town, was at Bawtry Fair, where
he got drunk; and, riding homeward down a hill, his horse came
down with him, and he fell with his face to the ground, and put
his neck out of joint. Those with him immediately pulled it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>again, and he lived till next day; but he never spoke more. His
face was torn all to pieces, one of his eyes beat out, his under lip cut
off, and his nose broken down. In short, he was one of the dreadfullest
examples of the severe justice of God that I have known.
This man, as he was one of the richest in this place, (Epworth,) so
he was one of the most implacable enemies your father had among
his parishioners; one that insulted him most basely in his troubles,
one that was ready to do him all the mischief he could; not to
mention his affronts to me and the children, and how heartily he
wished to see our ruin. This man, and one more, have been now
cut off, in the midst of their sins, since your father’s confinement.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The heroic wife, during the rector’s imprisonment, evinced fortitude,
fidelity, and love, worthy of herself. Money she had none,—not
a coin; the household lived on bread and milk, the produce
of the Epworth glebe; but she did what she could to help her
husband in his strait;—she sent him her little articles of jewellery,
including her wedding-ring; but these he sent her back, as things
far too sacred to be used in relieving his necessities. Brave-hearted
couple! The wife did her duty; but the husband’s soul
was far too noble to avail himself of such a sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his “Pious Communicant,” published in 1700, Samuel
Wesley puts into the reader’s mouth a beautiful prayer, which he
had doubtless often offered on his own behalf, and which, in his
present circumstances, was peculiarly appropriate. The prayer,
for itself, is worth preserving; and, in a narrative like this, is of
some importance, as illustrating the thoroughly devout and Christian
spirit of this much-tried godly minister. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“A PRAYER FOR ONE IN AFFLICTION AND WANT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“O God! who art infinite in power, and compassion, and goodness,
and truth! who hast promised in Thy holy Word, that Thou
wilt hear the prayer of the poor destitute, and wilt not despise his desire.
Look down, I beseech thee, from heaven, the habitation of Thy
holiness and glory, upon me a miserable sinner, now lying under
Thy hand in great affliction and sorrow. I am weary of my
groaning, my heart faileth me. The light of my eyes is gone
from me, I sink in the deep waters, and there is none to help me;
yet I wait still upon Thee my God. Though all the world forsake
me, let the Lord still uphold me, and in Him let me always find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>the truest, the kindest, the most compassionate, unwearied almighty
friendship. To Him let me ease my wearied soul, and
unbosom all my sorrows!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Help me, O Lord! against hope to believe in hope! Grant
that I may not be moved with all the slights and censures of a
mistaken world. Let me look by faith beyond this vale of tears
and misery, to that happy place which knows no pain, or want, or
sorrows. I know, O Lord! that a man’s life consists not in the
abundance of the things that he possesses, but that he who has
the most here, as he brought nothing with him into this world, so
he shall carry nothing out. I bless Thee that Thou hast not
given me my portion among those who have received all their
consolation here, whose portion is in this life only. Neither let
me expect those blessings which Thou hast promised to the poor,
unless I am really poor in spirit, and meek, and humble. I know
nothing is impossible with God, and that it is Thou alone who
givest power to get riches, and that Thou canst by Thy good providence,
raise me from this mean condition, whenever Thou pleasest,
and will certainly do it, if it be best for me. I therefore
humbly submit all unto Thy wise and kind disposal. I desire not
wealth or greatness. Give me neither extreme poverty, nor do I
ask riches of Thee, but only to be fed with food convenient for
me. I desire earnestly to seek first the kingdom of God and the
righteousness thereof, well hoping that, in Thy good time, food and
raiment, and all other things that be needful shall be added unto
me. I believe, O Lord! that Thou who feedest the ravens, and
clothest the lilies, wilt not neglect me and mine,—that thou wilt
make good Thy own unfailing promises,—wilt give meat to them
that fear Thee, and be ever mindful of Thy covenant. In the
meantime, let me not be querulous, or impatient, or envious at the
prosperity of the wicked; or judge uncharitably of those to whom
Thou hast given a larger portion of the good things of this life;
or be cruel to those who are in the same circumstances as myself.
Let me never sink or despond under my heavy pressures and continued
misfortunes. Though I fall, let me rise again. Let my
heart never be sunk so low that I should be afraid to own the
cause of despised virtue. Give me diligence, and prudence, and
industry, and let me neglect nothing that lies in me to provide
honestly for my own house, lest I be worse than an infidel. Help
me carefully to examine my life past; and, if by my own carelessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>or imprudence, I have reduced myself into this low condition,
let me be more deeply afflicted for it; but yet let me still hope in
Thy goodness, avoiding those failures whereof I have been formerly
guilty. Or, if for my sins Thou hast brought this upon me,
help me now, with submission and patience, to bear the punishment
of my iniquity. Or, if by Thy wise providence Thou art
pleased thus to afflict me for trial, and for the example of others,
Thy will, O my God! not mine, be done. Help me, and any
who are in the same circumstances, in patience to possess our
souls, and let all Thy fatherly chastisements advance us still nearer
towards Christian perfection. Teach us the emptiness of all things
here below—wean us more and more from a vain world. Fix our
hearts more upon heaven, and help us forward in the way that
leads to everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom
with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, honour, and power,
now and for ever. Amen!”<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Such a prayer as the above helps to supply the lack of a religious
diary; and so will the following extracts from letters written
immediately after Mr Wesley was released from Lincoln Castle.
It ought to be premised that all the letters were addressed to his
son Samuel, who was now sixteen years of age, and for two years
past had been a pupil in Westminster School:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>January 14, 1706</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Child</span>,—I now call you so, more on account of your
relation than your age; for you are past childhood, and I shall
hereafter use you with more freedom, and communicate my
thoughts to you as a friend as well as a father. Most of what I
write to you will be the result of my own dear-bought experience;
and you may expect a letter once a month at least; and I hope,
in mere civility, you will sometimes write again, unless my son,
too, has made a vow never to write to me more, as I am sometimes
inclined to think my mother has. If you think these letters
worth preserving, you may lay them together, and sometimes look
over them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall begin, as I ought, with piety, strictly so called, or your
duty towards God, which is the foundation of all happiness. I
hope you are tolerably grounded, for one of your age, in the principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>of natural religion, and the firm belief of the being of a
God, as well as of His providence, justice, and goodness, (if not,
look upon me, and doubt it if you can!) towards which you have
had considerable advantages in your reading so much of Tillotson,
while you were here, as well as in your mother’s most valuable
letter to you on that subject, which I hope you will not let mould
by you; I am sure you ought not to do it, for not many mothers
could write such a letter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now if there be a God, as it follows that He is just, good, and
powerful, so I leave it to your own thoughts whether it be not
our clearest interest, as well as honour and happiness, to serve
Him, and the greatest folly in the world not to do it. This service
must begin at the heart by fearing and loving Him. The way to
attain this happy temper is often to contemplate, deeply and
seriously, His attributes and perfections, especially His omniscience,
omnipresence, and justice for the former; and His beneficence
and love to mankind to excite the latter, particularly that
amazing instance of it—His sending His Son to die for us; which
that pious youth, Charles Goodall, (who went to heaven not much
older than you are,) could never reflect upon without rapture, as
I find by his papers now in my hands, and which, perhaps, you
and the public may sometime have a sight of.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another way to preserve and increase piety is to exercise it
in constant and fervent devotion. There never was a very good
man without constant secret prayer; as I know not how any can
be wicked while he conscientiously discharges that duty. If we
make our less necessary employments take the place of our stated
devotions—or, what is next to it, crowd them up into a narrow
room—we shall soon find our piety sensibly abate, and all that is
good ready to run to ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>“With these are to be enjoined the daily reading of God’s
Word, on no occasion to be omitted, and that with care and
observation, especially such passages as more immediately concern
your own case and the state of your soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Next to this, I can scarce recommend anything that would
more conduce to the advancement of true piety than your Christian
diary. I will not reproach you that a mother’s commands
were more prevalent than those of a father, for your resuming and
continuing it, since I am too well pleased that you have at last
done it. This, with the exercise which you will have, will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>you employment; and, therefore, you must be a good husband of
your time, and fix certain hours for everything, not neglecting
bodily exercise for the preservation of your health.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not time to close this head, but yet would not any
longer delay to write. I commend you to God’s gracious protection,
and would have you always remember that He sees and
loves you. Your mother will write soon to you. We are all well.—I
am your affectionate father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The following is an extract from a letter written seven months
after the date of the former one:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>August 15, 1706</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Child</span>,—My last related to that part of piety which is
to be exercised between God and your own soul. This will refer
to public devotion, which is our due homage to Almighty God,
and never ought to be neglected, unless in case of unavoidable
necessities, as sickness and the like, and therefore not for taking
physic, unless the case be very pressing; for you cannot expect to
gain anything in your studies by robbing God of that small moiety
of time. I understand you are now under the happy necessity of
being always present at public worship, of which I am very glad;
but then, you know, it is by no means sufficient to sit as God’s
people sit, if our hearts be far from Him. There ought to be a
due preparation of mind before you presume to approach the
house of God. When you are entering, remember whither you
are going; when present, remember where you are, and say, ‘How
dreadful is this place!’ Always consider the sacredness of it, on
account of its dedication and relation to God, and His presence in
it, as well as its sacred uses; for I suppose you are hardly of the
same mind with the rebellious assembly of divines, and I hope never
will be, who, as impudently as falsely, affirm, that ‘no place is holy
on account of any separation or dedication whatever.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will find the firm belief of God’s presence in His own
holy house of prayer will be of great advantage to you in fixing
your thoughts on the great work for which you come thither;
which, as soon as you enter, and when you take your seat, you
are to express in most humble adorations of body and mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>accompanied with some short prayer, either mental or vocal, suitable
to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the service begins, you are to join with it, and go along
with every part of it, with the utmost intension and most fervent
devotion; for which end keep your eye fixed upon your Prayer-book
or Bible, and let your eye go along with the priest, which
will keep your thoughts from wandering.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope you understand the cathedral service—I mean, understand
what they sing and say—which at first is something difficult.
Unless you understand what is said, you might as well pray in an
unknown tongue. On the contrary, if we do understand the
service and go along with it, we shall find Church music a great
help to our devotion, as it notably raises our affections towards
heaven; which, I believe, has been the experience of all good men,
unless they have been dunces or fanatics; nay, even the latter
confess the same of their own sorry Sternhold-psalms, which are
infinitely inferior to our cathedral music, as well as some thousands
of years of later date, not being of two hundred years standing.
We are not to think God has framed man in vain an harmonious
creature; and surely music cannot be better employed
than in the service and praises of Him who made both the tongue
and the ear. I hope you are not so weak as to be moved by the
wicked examples of idle lads who regard none of these things, or
by their scoffs for your doing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are to be very attentive to the sermon, because you know
in whose name and by whose commission it is delivered; and that
faith, and obedience too, come by hearing; this being God’s ordinance
for the conversion of mankind and the Church’s edification.
By practice you will be able to remember the principal parts of a
sermon; which, with a little pains, will add an habitual memory
to that good natural one wherewith God hath blessed you. When
you come home, immediately retire, either into your closet, or else
to some solitary walk in the park. There recollect what you have
heard, and fix what is observable in your memory, especially what
relates more immediately to yourself and to the state of your own
soul. This will be of great advantage to you, on more accounts
than one, for it will lay a good foundation of divinity, which study
you must always have in your eye, as being both designed for it,
and, I hope, inclined to it above any other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have a particular respect to the religion of the Sabbath, as all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>good men have ever had. Value highly that time, for as time, in
general, is the most precious thing in the world, so this is the
most precious of all others, and not designed for idle visits, but for
the concern of our souls, and communion with God in prayer and
praise, and other acts of piety and devotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope you dare not make any exercises upon it but what are
proper for the day, such as Judge Hale did; but then, have a care
lest, doing this as a school task only, it may not degenerate into
formality. Rob not yourself of so much pleasure and profit as
you will find in your translations of the Bible into verse, and Sunday
exercises of the same nature, if you are but so happy as to
reconcile fancy and devotion, which have too long been enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall not write anything to you concerning receiving the blessed
sacrament till towards spring; though I hope you frequently think
of it and long for it, as the dearest pledge of your Saviour’s love,
especially when you go home from church and see others stay to
receive it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And thus much, at present, of public worship.—I am, your
affectionate friend and father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Before proceeding to give further extracts from Mr Wesley’s letters,
there are two facts in the foregoing which demand attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first is, that the rector was a passionate admirer of sacred
music. Of this there can be no doubt. In one of his articles, in
the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, (vol. i. p. 393,) be strongly advocates the
duty of singing psalms in private families, and attributes the
neglect of this to the general decay of piety, though he admits
that the faultiness of the metrical versions of the psalms, and the
ill choice of tunes, may have had some influence in leading to such
neglect. In another article, in the same volume, (p. 440,) he says—“Nothing
but a stock is proof against the charms of music,
and especially when good sense, good poetry, good tunes, and a
good voice meet together.” In another article on the same subject,
in vol. iii. p. 95, he strongly complains of Sternhold’s version,
and adds, in reference to the tunes, that most of them are so vile
that even Orpheus himself could not make good music out of them.
“This, and the reading them at such a lame rate, tearing them
limb from limb, and leaving sense, cadency, and all at the mercy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>of the clerk’s nose, may be part of the reason why the Reformed
Churches are yet most remiss in psalmody.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it too much to say that the marvellous musical genius of his
two grandsons, Charles and Samuel Wesley, was inherited from
himself? So remarkable was this talent for music that Charles
surprised his father, by playing, with correctness, a tune on the
harpsichord before he was three years old; while Samuel taught
himself to read from Handel’s oratorios; had all the airs, recitations,
and choruses of “Samson” and the “Messiah,” both words and
notes, by heart before he was six years old; and, when he was
eight, composed and wrote his own oratorio of “Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The other fact, in the preceding letter, which deserves to be
noticed is, that Samuel Wesley recommends his son, as a Sabbath
exercise, to make “translations of the Bible into verse.” He was
as fond of sacred song as he was of sacred music. Besides his
poetical “Life of Christ,” he had already done what he recommends
to his son Samuel, for, in three volumes, he had turned the
whole of the histories of the Old and New Testaments into verse;
and, though his eldest son did not adopt his suggestion, it was
substantially adopted by his youngest son Charles, who, fifty-six years
afterwards, published in two volumes his “Short Hymns on Select
Passages of the Holy Scriptures;” the hymns being two thousand
and thirty in number, all founded upon particular texts, beginning
with Genesis and ending with the Revelation of St John.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the risk of being tedious, we cannot deny ourselves the gratification
of inserting the substance of two other letters, written
by Mr Wesley to his son Samuel, at Westminster School, in the
same year as the above were written, 1706:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>September 1706</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Child</span>,—The second part of piety regards your duty
towards your parents, towards whom I hope you will behave yourself
as you ought to the last moment of their lives.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some people, who are either fond of paradoxes, or have imbibed
ill principles from our modern plays and such like authors,
may, for aught I know, be in earnest when they defend that most
erroneous and unnatural principle that ‘we owe nothing to our
parents on account that they are the immediate authors of our
being.’ But these seem to forget that God himself, the common
Father of the universe, urges this as an argument against the ingratitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of his people, ‘Is he not thy Father?’ &amp;c. And again,
in Malachi, ‘If I be a father, where is my honour?’ Perhaps you
will think I am pleading my own cause, and so indeed I am, in
some measure; but it is the cause of my mother also, and even
your own cause, if ever you should have children, and, indeed, that
of nature and civil society, which would be dissolved or exceedingly
weakened if this great foundation-stone should be removed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know what you owe to one of the best of mothers. Perhaps
you may have read of one of the Ptolemies, who chose the
name of Philometer, as a more glorious title than if he had assumed
that of his predecessor, Alexander. And it would be an honest
and virtuous ambition in you to attempt to imitate him, for which
you have so much reason. Often reflect on the tender and peculiar
love which your dear mother has always expressed towards you;
the deep affliction of both body and mind which she underwent
for you, both before and after your birth; the particular care she
took of your education when she struggled with so many pains and
infirmities; and, above all, the wholesome and sweet motherly advice
and counsel which she has often given you to fear God, to take
care of your soul as well as of your learning, and to shun all vicious
and bad examples. You will, I verily believe, remember that these
obligations of gratitude, love, and obedience, and the expressions
of them are not confined to your tender years, but must last to the
very close of life, and, even after that, render her memory most dear
and precious to you.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will not forget to evidence this by supporting and comforting
her in her age, if it please God that she should ever attain
to it, (though I doubt she will not,) and doing nothing which may
justly displease or grieve her, or show you unworthy of such a
mother. You will endeavour to repay her prayers for you by
doubling yours for her; and, above all things, to live such a virtuous
and religious life that she may find that her care and love have
not been lost upon you, but that we may all meet in heaven.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In short, reverence and love her as much as you will, which I
hope will be as much as you can. For though I should be jealous
of any other rival in your heart, yet I will not be jealous of her;
the more duty you pay her, and the more frequently and kindly
you write to her, the more you will please your affectionate father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>This beautiful advice was not lost. Samuel Badcock, (no great
friend of the Wesley family,) in the third volume of the “Bibliotheca
Topographica Britannica,” published in 1790, writes:—“I
have in my possession a letter of this poor and aged parent, addressed
to his son Samuel, in which he gratefully acknowledges his
filial duty in terms so affecting that I am at a loss which to admire
most—the gratitude of the parent, or the affection and generosity
of the child. It was written when the good old man was nearly
fourscore, and so weakened by a palsy as to be incapable of
directing a pen, unless with his left hand. I preserve it as a
curious memorial of what will make Wesley applauded when his
wit is forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The next letter is as characteristic and as full of interest as any
of the preceding:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>November 8, 1706</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Child</span>,—After piety to God and to your parents, your
morals will fall next under consideration; or, your duty towards
yourself and your neighbour.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope I need not say much of justice toward your neighbour.
Its general rules are short and easy. ‘Doing as you would be
done by, and loving your neighbour as yourself;’ principles which
have been admired by wise and virtuous heathens when they have
heard them from the gospel; and which are, indeed, inscribed on
the hearts of all mankind as a part of the law—natural, though
much obliterated by the lapse of our nature and vicious habits.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for the regiment of your passions, all the rest depend, in a
great measure, on these two—love and hatred, or rather anger.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for love, I shall only say at present that whoever expects to
become anything in the world must guard against anti-Platonic
love in his youth, shut his eyes and heart against it, burn romances,
have a care of plays, and keep himself fully employed in some honest
exercise; and then, I think, he will be in no very great danger
from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But love takes in all desirable objects, or such as we fancy desirable;
and here the rule is, first, that it be fixed upon a lawful
object; and then, that it exceed not the due measure; since, if we
offend against the former part of this rule, it unavoidably renders
us criminal; if against the latter, at least ridiculous, imprudent,
and unhappy. Indeed, there is but one object of our love where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>we cannot transgress in loving too much; and that is God. Even
mediocrity is here a fault, which is both our wisdom and our virtue
in all other cases.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for hatred, I can scarce tell how it is possible to have it in
extremes against any one. For my own part, I have much ado to
hate the devil himself. I am sure I have often pitied him; and I
interpret those scriptures which speak of hating the wicked, &amp;c.,
as relating chiefly to their vices, for which we ought always to
have a just abhorrence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Anger, and some sort of aversion, I own to be more difficult
to subdue, though even these have too often pride or interest at
the bottom. There never was a truly great man who could not
bridle his passions. This, my boy, is what I wish you would do,
what I am sure you may do, and what would render you wiser and
greater than most part of mankind. This mastery of yourself will
cost you some pains before you can attain it; but it is richly worth
all your labour, since this wise and Christian temper will be so far
from inviting injuries, that you will have much fewer offered you
in the course of your life; and if any should be so devilish as to
do it, for that very reason, you will find they will glide very gently
off, and leave little or no impression behind them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And thus much of the government of your passions.—Your
affectionate father,</p>
<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Such are a few of the godly letters that were written by the
Epworth rector immediately after his release from Lincoln Castle.
We are loathe to leave so much Christian serenity, fatherly affection,
and manly sentiment, for the region of strife and contest;
and yet, to do justice to the subject of these memoirs, we must.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been already shown how Samuel Wesley was, unintentionally
on his part, involved in the Dissenting controversy. It was
most unwarrantable conduct in Mr Clavel to publish a letter which
the writer intended to be kept private; but, being published, and
being so savagely attacked by Mr Palmer, there was nothing for it
but for Samuel Wesley to defend himself. This he did in his
pamphlet, published in 1704. In 1705, Palmer published his
“Vindication,” in which Wesley was again offensively assailed.
Immediately after this, he was subjected to all the disgraceful persecutions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>that have been narrated, and, as a climax to the whole,
was thrust, by a revengeful spirit, into Lincoln Gaol. He had already
begun his “Reply to Mr Palmer’s Vindication,” and, during
his involuntary leisure within his prison-house, he finished it. It
consists of 155 pages quarto, and was published “for Robert Clavel,
at the Peacock, in St Paul’s Churchyard, in 1707.” It has on
the title-page, for a motto, the following sentence from the writings
of Defoe:—“How long must we see the reproaches of our
Establishment and the insults of the laws, and be bound to silence,
and to say nothing for peace’ sake? How long must their false
prophets and dreamers of dreams abuse us, and we be obliged to
hold our peace?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The book consists of nine chapters and an introduction.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the introduction, Wesley states that Palmer has charged him
with publishing “scandalous, wicked, malicious, envious, spiteful,
injurious, base, bold, daring, rampant, downright, positive, complicated,
abominable falsehoods.” He says Palmer regales him by
applying to him the epithets following:—“Cruel, unjust, wicked,
silly, wretched, flagrant, spiteful, impertinent, insidious, scandalous,
impudent, barefaced, perfidious, ingrate, sycophant, delator
and informer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley’s “Reply” was written at the request of his bishop,
who offered to assist him with materials for the work, and revised
part of it before it was printed.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> It is elaborate and able; but a
lengthened review of it, at this period, would be useless. We
content ourselves, therefore, with giving a few matters of fact in
the order in which the book contains them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley declares that the Dissenters were now “choosing lads of
the most pregnant parts, and were educating them at the public
schools of the Church, as St Paul’s and others, with the intention
to transplant them thence to Dissenting academies, and from
thence into a martial phalanx to attack the Church with greater
success than their <a id='corr316.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='predecessors'>predecessors”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_316.33'><ins class='correction' title='predecessors'>predecessors”</ins></a></span> (p. 7.)</p>

<p class='c001'>In the 15th page, Wesley strangely enough “thanks God that
the Act of Uniformity is not repealed, and that all the strength
of the Dissenters cannot prevail to repeal it!” Remembering
what his father and his grandfather were made to suffer by that
Act, one cannot help but think that there is hardly good taste in
this.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Wesley says he can give the name of a famed Dissenting minister
who was active in taking away all our legal securities, and
caballed with those who were favourites at Court. He and his
proselytes met at a house not far from the Poultry Church, whither
many of the Dissenting ministers usually resorted. When Wesley
had just returned to London from the university, those caballers
used all the arguments they could think of to persuade him to
join them; but he writes:—“I thank God I abhorred their proposals,
and never saw them more, unless I accidentally met them,”
(pp. 62 and 63.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Palmer, in his “Vindication,” had alleged that Benjamin
Bridgewater, the Calves-head poet, learned to sing “To Puss, Boys”
in Trinity College, Cambridge, thereby intending to cast a slur
upon the reputation of the Church. Wesley replies:—“I am
sorry they won’t suffer poor Ben (my successor in the favours of
the party) to be quiet in his grave.” He then proceeds to show
that poor Ben, for bad behaviour, was forced to leave Cambridge
University some years before the song “To Puss, Boys” was published,
and that when he came to London he took sanctuary among
Dissenters, and wrote the anthems of the Calves-head Club, by
which he became the darling of the party, and was entertained
and caressed at their <a id='corr316.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='houses,”'>houses,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_316.23'><ins class='correction' title='houses,”'>houses,</ins></a></span>(p. 65.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley declares that up to the time that his “letter” was published
by Clavel, and he published his “Defence,” his best friends
were all Dissenters, but that now he had lost their favour, because
he could not comply with their proposals to retract the truths that
he had written concerning Dissenting matters. He writes:—“You
cannot say but that my behaviour towards you has been inoffensive
during the many years which have elapsed since I left
you. I have received common civilities from some of your persuasion,
and have, in my turn, obliged them as occasion offered.
I never desired your destruction, but your reformation. I showed
no great fondness to engage against you. It was a mere accident
that occasioned it, and I sent you fair warning long before I began
to write my defence. I am of no party that I know of, unless you
reckon those to be such who desire you should neither distress
nor overtop the Establishment,” (p. 73.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley says Palmer accuses him of bowing and cringing to the
Dissenters since he had joined the Church. He replies:—“I own
this to be true, for I have often asked my father-in-law’s, and my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>mother’s blessing, and I did once bow down in the house of Rimmon;
but for the rest nobody ever accused me that my knees were
<em>suppled</em>,” (p. 99.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley relates a story to the effect that on January 31st, 1698,
which happened to be Sunday, a clergyman near London was
preaching a sermon, from 1 Peter, ii. 13, in reference to the
martyrdom of King Charles, and that nine pupils from a neighbouring
Dissenting Academy came to hear him. After the service,
a deputation of two of them waited upon him and invited
him to a noble entertainment to be given the same evening. The
clergyman refused. They then began to quarrel with his sermon,
and said Charles I. was “a cursed tyrant, and that his death was
the just execution of a damned malefactor.” The next day, the
same clergyman received a letter signed Timothy Greybeard, stating,
that, if he had gone as invited to the supper on the night
previous, they would have given him, as “the principal dish, the
best calf’s-head they could have procured for love or money; and
that, if he had been inclined to drink a health to the sanctified
head, there would have been good humming liquor to have
washed his conscience in a few gulps,” (p. 100.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley acknowledges that, when he was a pupil in the Dissenting
Academy, three arch lasses made a fool of him by clothing
him in a cloak, and sending him through St Paul’s Churchyard to
ask for Rochester’s “Divine Poems;” but he indignantly denies
that he ever kept any lewd company, though he says it was “one
of the happiest providences of his life that he did not, and that he
had a narrow escape from debauchery and ruin.” He adds,
“Though I kept no such company, I know too many Dissenters
that did, and know where they have made assignations with them,
in your very meetings, though it is possible that, in twenty years,
those ladies may be advanced to a more venerable character than
they then possessed,” (pp. 139 and 140.) He further states that
the majority of the Dissenters, with whom he had been acquainted,
preferred a commonwealth to a monarchy, abhorred the memory
of Charles I., and the name and race of the Stuarts; and that they
could not deny that lewdness and debauchery were not uncommon
in their academies as well as in other places, (p. 143.)</p>

<p class='c001'>In closing the controversy, Mr Wesley says, that when he was
last in London, in January and February 1705, he was often
ruffled by being urged to retract, or at least palliate his charges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>against the Dissenters; and that, as he was about to receive the
sacrament, he wrote the following protestation, and sent it to the
clergyman who was to officiate:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“I take this opportunity solemnly to declare, that what I have
written in relation to the Dissenters, in my letter, and the defence
of it, is strictly true, and that I have not wilfully charged them
with anything that is otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr319.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“He'>He</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_319.8'><ins class='correction' title='“He'>He</ins></a></span>adds, “After the delivery of this, I bless God I <em>received</em>
with as great quiet and satisfaction as I hope I should die with,
if God should call me to witness to the truth with my last
breath.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If in the heat of controversy I have unadvisedly used any expressions
in this or in any other of my writings, that either may
reflect too severely on a whole body of men, among whom I doubt
not there are many who fear God and have a zeal for Him, though
I think it is not according to knowledge, or which have not been
agreeable to the spirit of Christianity and the example of my great
Master, I do heartily, very heartily, ask pardon both of God and
them, as I desire the same for my greatest enemies; and having
written this, and again and again reviewed and weighed it, I am
not much concerned for the consequence of it as to this world,
but shall conclude as our Church does one part of our Litany,
‘In all time of our tribulation, in all time of our wealth, in the
hour of death, and in the day of judgment—good Lord, deliver
us.’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>We now subjoin two letters written by Mr Wesley in the year
in which his last controversial work was published. Both were
addressed to his son Samuel, now King’s Scholar, in Westminster
School:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>October 2, 1707</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sam</span>,—Read the histories of Joseph, of Daniel, and of
Lot; and, if you please, the thirteenth satire of Juvenal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remember, God sees, and will punish and reward.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you can get no other time to say your prayers, you may do
it as you seem to be reading, for done it must be, or you know
what follows! But have not you time when you sit up to
watch?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“That God may evermore preserve you, is the prayer of your
affectionate father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Dec. 29, 1707</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Child</span>,—I was pleased to see in your last that you
expressed an inclination to repose a more than ordinary confidence
in me. I have endeavoured to show that I really value your
affection, and I should be very well satisfied if you looked upon
me as your friend, as well as your father. Sammy, believe it, there
are but few in the world that are fit to be trusted with our weaknesses
and most private thoughts; and yet it is exceedingly convenient
to have some one to whom one might safely communicate
them, especially in youth, when first launching into the world.
I know there are not many who would choose a father for this;
but since you are inclined to do it, perhaps it shall not be the
worse for you, and I will promise you so much secrecy, that even
your mother shall know nothing but what you have a mind she
should, for which reason it may be convenient you should write
to me still in Latin.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is agreed by all that a pure body and a chaste mind are
an acceptable sacrifice to infinite Purity and Holiness; and that,
without these, a thousand hecatombs would never be accepted.
How happy are those who preserve their first purity and innocence;
and how much easier is it to abstain from the first acts,
than not to reiterate them and sink into inveterate habits! There
is no parleying with the temptation to this sin, which is nourished
by sloth and intemperance. You have not wanted repeated warnings,
and I hope they have not been altogether in vain. The
shortness, the baseness, the nastiness of the pleasure would be
enough to make one nauseate it did not the devil and the flesh
unite in their temptations to it. However, conquered it must be,
for we must part with that or heaven! Ah, my boy, what sneaking
things does vice make us! What traitors to ourselves, and
how false within! And what invincible courage, as well as calmness,
attends virtue and innocence!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, my boy, (it is likely,) begins that conflict whereof I have
so often warned you, and which will find you warm work for some
years. Now vice or virtue, God or Satan, heaven or hell, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>will you choose? What, if you should fall on your knees this
moment, or as soon as you can retire, and choose the better part?
If you have begun to do amiss, resolve to do better. Give up
yourself solemnly to God and to His service. Implore the mercy
and gracious aid of your Redeemer, and the blessed assistance
(perhaps the return) of the Holy Comforter. You will not be cast
off. You will not want strength from above, which will be infinitely
beyond your own, or even the power of the enemy. The
holy angels are spectators, and will rejoice at your conquest. Why
should you not make your parents’ heart rejoice. You know how
tenderly they are concerned for you, and how fain they would
have you virtuous and happy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot close my letter without adding something remarkable
that has lately happened in our town (though it is not over-fruitful
in adventures) which may afford you some useful remarks.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your worthy schoolmaster, John Holland, whose kindness
you wear on your knuckles, after having cost his father, Thomas
Holland, two or three hundred pounds at the University, in hopes
he would live to help his sister and brothers, and for want of which
the poor old man now lies in Lincoln Gaol, without any hopes of
liberty unless death should set him free; after having been in
thirteen places, and pawned his gown and clothes almost as often,
being thrown out wherever he came for his wickedness and lewdness—was
making homewards about a month or six weeks since,
and got within ten or a dozen miles of Epworth, where he fell sick,
out of rage or despair, and was brought home to the parish in a
cart, and has lain almost mad since he came hither. Peter Forster,
the Anabaptist preacher, gave him twopence to buy some brandy,
and thought he was very generous. His mother fell a-cursing God
when she saw him. She has been with me to beg the assistance
of the parish for him. What think you of this example?—I am,
your affectionate father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The above letter is a beautiful example of the loving confidence
which ought to exist between a father and his children. It also
affords incidental evidence, which refutes the commonly-received
opinion, that the early education of the Wesley children was devolved
exclusively on the mother. There can be no doubt that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Susannah Wesley educated her children up to a certain point, but
who taught the sons and some of the daughters the elements of
Greek and Latin? From the foregoing letter, it is undeniable
that, though Susannah Wesley was a thorough master of the English
language, and had a respectable knowledge of the French, she
was not so familiar with Latin as to be able to read it without
difficulty; and, if so, there can be little question that, whatever
knowledge the sons, and two or three of the daughters had of the
classic tongues, was communicated by their father; for, though
Samuel seems to have had a half brutalized tutor for a time,
there is no evidence that any other of the children had a like
provision. In the first place, the rector could not afford it; and,
secondly, there was no need of it, for he himself was one of the
best classical scholars of his day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wesley had now eight children, and two more were intrusted to
him afterwards. We have already sketched all that were born up
to the year 1697. In 1701 the rector’s wife had twins, both of
whom died in infancy. In 1702 occurred the birth of their daughter
Anne. At the age of about twenty-three she married Mr John
Lambert, a land-surveyor at Epworth. Lambert was an educated
man, and was particularly careful to collect the early pamphlet
publications of his father-in-law, Mr Samuel Wesley, from which
collection, and from Lambert’s manuscript notes, Dr Adam Clarke
derived considerable assistance in his compilation of the Memoirs
of the Wesley Family. Mr and Mrs Lambert, in 1737, were residing
at Hatfield, where they were visited by Charles Wesley.
Lambert was betrayed into drinking habits by his brother-in-law,
the wretched Wright; but Charles Wesley laboured to reclaim
him, and it is hoped with good effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the eventful year 1703, when Mr Wesley’s unfortunate letter
was published by Mr. Clavel, his son John was born; but of him
we need say nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1705, the year that Mr Wesley was imprisoned, another
child was born; and, as already stated, was smothered by its
nurse, and thrown dead into its mother’s arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1707, the year in which Wesley wrote the preceding letters
to his son Samuel, his daughter Martha was given him. Martha
was reputed, by her sisters, to be the mother’s favourite; and certainly
Martha loved and almost idolised her mother. From her
infancy she was remarkable for deep thoughtfulness, for equanimity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>of temper, and for serious deportment. Her brothers and
sisters would use all kinds of witty mischief to ruffle her; but in
vain. The likeness between herself and her brother John was so
exact, that Dr Clarke declares, if he had seen them dressed in the
same attire, he could not have distinguished the one from the
other. Their disposition also was the same; and even their hand-writing
was so much alike that the one might be easily mistaken
for the other. At the age of thirteen, she went to live with her
uncle Matthew in London, and remained with him for the space
of a dozen years.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Here she became acquainted with Westley
Hall, who was one of the pupils of her brother John, at Lincoln
College. Hall, at that time, was a man of agreeable person, pleasing
manners, and good property. He fell in love with Martha,
and made her an offer of marriage. Without consulting any of
her family she accepted him. Within a week he went with her
brothers John and Charles to Epworth, where he grew enamoured
of her younger sister Kezziah, made an engagement to marry her,
and was on the point of leading her to the altar, when a sudden
qualm of conscience reminded him of his previous engagement,
and he came back to Martha. They were married in 1735, (the
year in which her father died;) and her uncle Matthew gave her
a dowry of £500. Hall, for a time, behaved like a gentleman and
a Christian, and honourably fulfilled his duties as a curate of the
Church of England at Salisbury. He then became a Moravian
and Quietist, an Antinomian, a Deist, if not an Atheist, and a
Polygamist, which last he defended in his teaching, and illustrated
by his practice. While a curate at Salisbury, he seduced one of
his servants, and was afterwards guilty of many similar infidelities.
Once when Charles Wesley was preaching at Bristol, and had his
sister Patty for a hearer, Hall came into the room and took her
off with him. On another occasion at Salisbury, he turned both
her and her brother John out of doors. Samuel Wesley, jun.,
never liked him. In a letter to John he says—“I never liked the
man from the first time I saw him. His smoothness never suited
my roughness. He appeared always to dread me as a wit. This,
with me, is a sure sign of guilt and hypocrisy. He was afraid I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>should see it, if I looked keenly into his eye.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a> After being the
father of ten children by his wife, nine of whom lie buried at
Salisbury, Hall abandoned his family, went off to the West Indies
with one of his mistresses, lived with her there till she died, and
afterwards returned to England, where, professing penitential sorrow,
he was cordially received by his injured and incomparable
wife, who showed him every Christian attention till his death,
which took place at Bristol, Jan. 6, 1776. John Wesley buried
him, and says—“God had given him deep repentance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was poor Patty’s worthless and vagabond husband; and
yet, in the midst of all her trials, she acted the part of a perfect
Christian. Out of sheer pity, she actually gave money to one of
her husband’s abandoned concubines; and, on another occasion,
when he, with frontless inhumanity, brought home one of his illegitimate
infants, and commanded his wife to take charge of it till
he could make other provision for it, she ordered a cradle to be
brought, placed the babe in it, and continued to perform for it all
the requisite acts of humanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs Hall often dined with Dr Johnson at Bolt Court; he
ardently admired her, and always treated her with great reverence
and respect. In many cases, her conversation supplied to Johnson
the place of books; for her memory was a repository of the most
striking events of past centuries; and she had the best parts of
all the English poets by heart. Of wit she used to say, she was
the only one of the family without it; and her brother Charles
remarked that “Sister Patty was always too wise to be witty.”
One of her peculiarities was, she could never be induced to behold
a corpse, “Because,” said she, “it is beholding sin sitting
upon his throne.” Mrs Hall died on the 12th of July 1791, her
last words being, “I have the assurance which I have long prayed
for. Shout!” She was the last survivor of the original Wesley
family; her father, mother, brothers, and sisters having all died
before her. In all respects, she was a remarkable woman; but, in
Christian charity, was pre-eminent. Her brother Charles was
accustomed to say, “It is in vain to give Pat anything to add to
her comforts, for she always gives it away to some person poorer
than herself.” In the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for 1791, p. 684,
there is the following obituary notice:—“July 12, in the City
Road, in her eighty-fourth year, Mrs Martha Hall, widow of the Rev.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Mr H., and last surviving sister of the Rev. John and Charles
Wesley. She was equally distinguished by piety, understanding,
and sweetness of temper. Her sympathy for the wretched, and
her bounty even to the worthless, will eternise her name in better
worlds than this.”<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the year 1708, Charles Wesley was born, and two years afterwards
Kezziah, the youngest of the rector’s children that survived
the days of infancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout life Kezziah Wesley’s health was delicate, in consequence
of which she was prevented from improving a mind that
seems to have been capable of high cultivation. When she was
about nineteen years of age, she became a teacher in a boarding-school
in Lincoln, where she complains of the want of clothes and
of money, but wishes to remain for the purpose of completing her
education. She had an insatiable thirst for knowledge, both
divine and human; but her bad health rendered her almost incapable
of close mental application. We refrain from again adverting
to the distressing acquaintance with Westley Hall; suffice it to
say, that after this she for a time was boarded at the house of
the venerable Vicar of Bexley, the Rev. Mr Piers. She afterwards
was domiciled with an aunt at Islington, and her brother Samuel
offered her a home at Tiverton. It was not long that she needed
the kindness of her friends, for, at the age of thirty-one, she
peacefully expired. Her brother Charles gives the following account
of her death:—“Yesterday morning, March 9, 1741, sister
Kezzy died in the Lord Jesus. He finished His work, and cut it
short in mercy; full of thankfulness, resignation, and love, without
pain or trouble, she commended her spirit into the hands of
Jesus, and fell asleep.”<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the members of the Wesley family. “Such a family,”
writes Dr Clarke, “I have never read of, heard of, or known; nor
since the days of Abraham and Sarah, and Joseph and Mary, has
there ever been a family to which the human race has been more
indebted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles Wesley tells us that he has heard his father say, “God
had shown him he should have all his nineteen children about him
in heaven;”<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a> and there is little doubt that, for more than seventy
years past, this hope of the rector has been realised.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br />FIRE AND FURY-1709-1712.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On two previous occasions Samuel Wesley had been a heavy
sufferer by fire. In 1702, two-thirds of his parsonage was burnt;
and, in 1704, all his flax shared the same disastrous fate. Five
years after this, another, and even more serious, fire occurred. On
February 9, 1709, at midnight, when all the family were in bed,
Hetty, who was now twelve years old, was awoke by sparks of
fire falling from the roof upon her feet. On account of severe
illness from which his wife was suffering, Samuel Wesley was
sleeping in a separate room. Hetty ran to alarm him, and, at the
same moment, he was startled by a cry of fire out of doors. He
hurried to Mrs Wesley, and bid her and her eldest daughters rise
as quickly as possible. He then burst open the nursery door,
where in two beds were sleeping five of his children and their
nurse. The nurse seized Charles, the youngest, and bid the others
follow. Three of the elder children did as they were bidden; but
John was left sleeping. All the family excepting him, a child
seven years of age, were in the hall surrounded with flames and
unable to escape, the key of the door being above stairs. Mr
Wesley ran up and recovered the key a minute before the stair
steps took fire. The door was now opened, but the wind drove
the flames inwards with such violence that egress seemed impossible.
Some of the children now escaped through the windows,
and the rest through a little door into the garden. Mrs Wesley
was not in a condition either to climb to the windows or get
to the garden door; and, naked as she was, she was compelled to
force her way to the main entrance through the fury of the flames,
which she did, suffering no further harm than the scorching of
her legs, hands, and face.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Mr Wesley was counting heads to see if all his family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>were safe, he heard a cry issuing from the nursery, and found
that John was wanting. He attempted to ascend the stairs, but
they were all on fire, and were insufficient to bear his weight.
Finding it impossible to render help, he knelt down in the blazing
hall and commended the soul of his child to God. Meanwhile
the child had mounted a chest which stood near the window,
and one in the yard saw him, and proposed running to fetch a
ladder for his escape. Another seeing there was not time for
that, proposed that he would fix himself against the wall, and
that a lighter man should be set upon his shoulders. This was
done—the child was pulled through the window; and, at the
same instant, the roof fell with a fearful crash, but fortunately
fell inwards, and thus the two men and the rescued child were
saved from perishing. When the child was taken to an adjoining
house where his father was, the devout rector cried, “Come,
neighbours, let us kneel down; let us give thanks to God; He
has given me all my eight children; let the house go; I am rich
enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The next day, as he was walking in his garden, and mournfully
surveying the ruins of his house, he descried part of a leaf of his
Polyglott Bible, on which the only words legible were: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vade,
vende omnia quae habes, et attolle crucem, et sequere me.”</span> “Go,
sell all that thou hast; and take up thy cross, and follow me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The house, the furniture, and the rector’s library were burnt;
but perhaps the severest loss, at least to posterity, was the destruction
of manuscripts. This included Mr Wesley’s long-continued
literary correspondence, the writings of his wife, and many important
papers relative to the Annesley family, and particularly
to Dr Annesley himself;—papers which the doctor had intrusted
to Mrs Wesley as his best beloved child. Besides these, all the
sermons of the rector were consumed, and likewise a large and important
manuscript on Hebrew poetry, in which he had turned the
book of Psalms, and all the Hebrew hymns in the Pentateuch,
and in the book of Judges, into verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few small mementoes of this terrible calamity were preserved,
and among others a hymn, written by Samuel Wesley, with music
adapted, probably by Henry Purcell or Dr Blow. This hymn is
the only one, by the rector of Epworth, that finds a place in the
Methodist Hymn-Book, and there even it is curtailed. We
present it to the reader complete.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Samuel Wesley himself wrote an account of this dire disaster
to his old patron, the Duke of Buckingham; and that account contains
some particulars not included in the preceding statement,
taken from the description furnished by his wife. He says, that
on the day when the fire occurred they had been brewing, but had
finished the operation at least six hours before the flames broke
out. He was in his study till half-past ten o’clock, but neither saw
nor smelled anything of fire. The reason why he slept in a room
separate from his wife was because she was near her confinement.
Her daughters, Emilia and Susannah, were sleeping with her.
When he was aroused by the cry of fire, he ran to her room with
his nightgown and one stocking on, and his breeches in his hand.
They had about £20, in gold and silver, in the room occupied
by Mrs Wesley, which she wanted to take with her; but there
was no time for this, and she had to escape for her life as she
left her bed. The whole family had to flee in nothing but their
night-dresses. While the nurse was escaping with the infant
child, Charles, in her arms, she was saluted with a curse by one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>of the neighbours, and told that they had fired the house themselves,
the second time, on purpose. While Wesley was running
about the street, inquiring for his wife and children, he met the
chief man and chief constable of the town going from the house,
not towards it. Wesley took him by the hand and said, “God’s
will be done!” His surly answer was, “Will you never have
done with your tricks? You fired your house once before. Did
you not get money enough by it then that you have done it
again?” Wesley replied, “God forgive you! I find you are
chief, Maw, still.” When he found his wife she was almost
speechless. She had waded, at the peril of her life, through two
or three yards of flame, having nothing on but her shoes and
a wrapping gown, and a loose coat, which she held about her
breast. He adds, “When poor Jackey was saved, I could not
believe it till I had kissed him two or three times. My wife
said, ‘Are your books safe?’ I told her it was not much,
now she and all the rest were preserved alive. A little lumber
was saved below stairs; but not one rag or leaf above. We
found some of the silver in a lump, which I shall send up to Mr
Hoare to sell for me. Mr Smith, of Gainsborough, and others,
have sent for some of my children. I want nothing, having above
half my barley safe in my barns unthrashed. I had finished my
alterations in the ‘Life of Christ’ a little while since, and transcribed
three copies of it; but all is lost. God be praised! I
know not how to write to my poor boy Samuel; and yet I must,
or else he will think we are all lost. I hope my wife will recover
and not miscarry, but God will give me my nineteenth child.
She has burnt her legs; but they mend. When I came to her
her lips were black. I did not know her. Some of the children
are a little burnt, but not hurt or disfigured. I only got a small
blister on my hand. The neighbours send us clothes, for it is cold
without them.”<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>How are we to account for these repeated fires at the Epworth
parsonage? Were they the effect of design or of accident? Mr
Maw, the chief man of the town, who more than thirty years
afterwards seems to have been a friend to John Wesley, and to
one of his itinerants, (<i>see</i> Wesley’s <cite>Works</cite>, vol. i. pp. 438 and 485;
also, vol. ii. p. 45,) most cruelly charged Mr Wesley with setting
fire to the house himself. A more atrocious accusation could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>have been cast upon him. What reason on earth was there to
induce such a man to commit such an act? It is true, he might
expect money to be given to rebuild his house; but was that
sufficient to induce a man of Wesley’s high character to destroy
not only all his furniture, but his books, sermons, and manuscripts;
to run the risk of killing himself, his wife, and his eight children;
and, at the least, to leave the whole of them, in the depth of winter,
without a shred of clothing, and without a hut to shelter
them; the whole family, to use the rector’s own language, being
reduced, in regard to house, furniture, and clothes, to the same
state as that in which “Adam and Eve were when they first set
up housekeeping?” To suppose the very possibility of such a
thing is a most monstrous outrage against reason and common
sense; and when such an accusation was made by “the chief man
of the town,” and by the foul-mouthed blasphemer that cursed
the nursemaid and little Charles, one cannot help suspecting that
this was done, not because they thought the rector guilty, but in
order to hide the guilt of the execrable villains whom they knew
or suspected to be the actual perpetrators of the deed.</p>

<p class='c001'>If Wesley, then, was not himself the incendiary, was the fire an
accident? This also is unlikely. The fire did not occur in summer,
when a spark might ignite the thatch, but in winter, when
the thatch was saturated with rain, and snow. It occurred not
in the day time, but at the hour of midnight, when all the fires
of the house were extinguished. It broke out not in the lower
part of the house, but in the roof of the corn-chamber,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a> filled with
wheat and other grain,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> and therefore must have been lighted
from without. Wesley supposes the possibility of the chimney
having taken fire; but, as a set-off against such a supposition, he
adds that the chimney had recently been swept, and that when he
went to bed, about half an hour before the flames were seen, he
neither saw nor smelled anything of fire. Put all these facts together,
and the conclusion is almost inevitable that the house was
not fired either by Wesley himself, or by accident. If, then, the
house was not fired by the rector himself, nor yet by accident, how
did the disaster happen? John Wesley, and probably his father,
held the opinion that the house was designedly set on fire by some
of Mr Wesley’s enemies. What evidence is there in favour of this
opinion?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>First of all, there is the fact that, during the last six years, Mr
Wesley had taken a prominent part in the great controversy of the
period,—the exceedingly bitter controversy between the Dissenters
and the High-Church party of the Church of England. This had
made him many enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, he had, four years before, in the severely contested
county election, incurred great opprobrium, and not a little danger,
by voting for the Tory and High-Church candidates.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, he had to deal with dishonest parishioners, and did not
always treat them with the utmost discretion. Take a case in
point. Many of the parishioners gave him trouble about his
tithes, and, at one time, would only pay in kind. Going into a
field where the tithe corn was already separated from the rest, Mr
Wesley found the farmer very deliberately cutting off the ears of
corn from Wesley’s tithe sheaves, and putting them into a bag.
Wesley walked up to him, but, instead of accusing him of his
shabby theft, took him by the arm, and walked with him into
Epworth. Reaching the market-place, the rector suddenly seized
the farmer’s bag, and turning it inside out before all the people,
told them of the petty pilfering of which the farmer had been
guilty. He then left him, with his scattered spoils, to the judgment
of his neighbours, and, with the utmost composure, went
home to his wife and family. The beggarly thief richly deserved
such a withering exposure; but such treatment was likely to turn
such delinquents into most insatiable enemies.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, added to all this, it must be borne in mind that, at
this period, the people in the neighbourhood of Epworth, and living
in the Isle of Axholme, were little better than Christian savages,
and that it was no unusual thing for them to vent their hatred by
burning the crops and the farm-steads of those whom they regarded
as their enemies. A few years before the burning of the
parsonage, a Mr Reading, with commendable spirit, had enclosed
about a thousand acres of Epworth manor with a good substantial
fence, and had ploughed it, and used other means to make it productive;
and, for this enterprising act and for other reasons, the
half-brutal inhabitants assaulted him and his servants wherever
they had a chance, and even fired guns at them. They destroyed all
Mr Reading’s out-buildings and his tenants’ houses; they chipped
his fruit-trees, burnt his fences, and turned his cattle into his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>standing corn; and finally they fired his house, with the intention
of burning him, his wife, and his children in their beds. This
lawless mob was headed by a furious, termagant woman, called
Popplewell; and she and some others of her companions were
indicted at Lincoln assizes, in 1694, and were convicted, but,
strangely enough, were allowed to escape punishment by the payment
of a paltry fine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Reading, after this, rebuilt his burnt house at a short distance
from the site of the former one; but no sooner was it
finished than it was set on fire during the night, the key-holes of
the doors being filled with clay to prevent the family making their
escape. This was in April 1697; and two months afterwards, as
though it was not enough to burn a man’s house twice over, the
rioters proceeded to pull down his farm buildings, broke his lead
pump in pieces, cut down his orchard, and burnt all his implements
of husbandry.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a> One reason assigned for all this lawless
outrage was that Mr Reading had been appointed to collect the
rents of the sixty thousand acres of swamps in the Isle of Axholme,
which, at an expense of £56,000, had been drained during
the reign of Charles 1., and on which recovered lands about two
hundred Dutch families and a number of French Protestants had
settled. For more than fifty years tumults were continual; and,
in 1702, Mr Reading drew up a memorial, in which he mentions
his “having provided horses, arms, and necessaries, with twenty
hired men, and often more,” to maintain the peace; and, that
“after thirty-one set battles,” he had reduced the riotous inhabitants
to obedience. Proceedings in Chancery were instituted, but
these unhappy disputes, respecting the proprietaryship of the soil,
were not finally adjusted till 1719.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was among such half-civilised savages that Samuel Wesley
lived and laboured. No wonder that, as in the case of his neighbour
Mr Reading, his house and premises should be set on fire
once and again within the space of seven short years. At that
period this was the way in which the men of the Isle of Axholme
displayed and gratified their malignant and revengeful feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second burning of Mr Wesley’s parsonage was a terrible
calamity. Apart from the loss of his furniture, books, and manuscripts,
it was a serious trial for himself, his pregnant wife, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>his seven children, to be left without a home, and almost without
a rag to hide their nakedness. The children were divided among
their neighbours, relatives, and friends, Matthew Wesley, the surgeon,
taking two, Susannah and Mehetabel. The rector and his
wife, of course, had to remain at Epworth, and provide for themselves
in the best way they could. The house was rebuilt within a
year after it was burnt; but the rector was so impoverished that
thirteen years afterwards his wife declares that the house was still
not half furnished, and that to that very day she and her children
had not more than half enough of clothing.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> No wonder; for, in
the self-same letter, Mrs Wesley expressly states that, after deducting
“taxes, poor assessments, sub-rents, tenths, procurations, and
synodals,” the Epworth living brought them not more than about
£130 a year. Out of that amount the rector had to re-furnish his
house, re-stock his library, find food and clothing for a family of
ten or twelve, and provide the best education for his children that
he could.</p>

<p class='c001'>The new parsonage was a great improvement upon the old
thatched building that was burnt. It is thus described by Dr
Adam Clarke, who visited it one hundred and eleven years after it
was built:—“It is a large, plain mansion, built of brick, with a
canted roofed and tiled; a complete old-fashioned family house,
and very well suited for nineteen children. The attic floor is entirely
from end to end of the whole building; the floor terraced,
and evidently designed for a repository of the tithe corn, and
where it would be kept cool and safe. In the churchyard there is
a sycamore tree, which was planted by the hand of old Samuel
Wesley, and which is exactly two fathoms in circumference. It is
become hollow at the root, and is decaying fast. It is well grown,
and has shot out strong and powerful boughs, but some have already
dropt off, and, after a few more years, it will have neither
root nor branch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was in 1821. Dr A. Clarke represents the people of Epworth,
at that time, as having “but little polish, but no boorishness
in their manners.” They appeared to be good-natured, simple,
sincere, humble, and singularly modest, and retained “the manners
of the better part of the peasants of two hundred years ago,”
so that, of course, in the doctor’s estimation, they were still, notwithstanding
all their improvements, two hundred years behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>their age. The doctor, however, was highly gratified with his
visit; brought away with him a pair of fire-tongs which had
once been the property of Samuel Wesley; and mentions a fact
unparalleled in his travellings, viz., that, on leaving Epworth, he
“had no road for upwards of forty miles, but travelled through
fields of corn, wheat, rye, potatoes, barley, and turnips, often
crushing them under the carriage wheels.” Even as late as 1821,
there seems to have been no better road to Epworth than this.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the same year that the Epworth parsonage was burnt, great
excitement was created in the nation by two turbulent sermons
preached by Dr Henry Sacheverell, one at Derby, the other at St
Paul’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry Sacheverell was ten years younger than Samuel Wesley.
He obtained the rudiments of education from a village schoolmaster,
at the cost of an apothecary, on whose death, his widow
sent the youth to Magdalene College, Oxford. Here he distinguished
himself by some clever poems in Latin; was chosen fellow
of his college, and became tutor to several pupils who afterwards
attained great eminence. His first preferment in the Church was
to the living of Cannock, in Staffordshire; whence he removed,
in 1705, to St Saviour’s, Southwark. Four years after his removal
hither, he preached the sermons already mentioned. The sermon
at Derby, was preached at the assizes, August 15, 1709, and
is entitled, “The Communication of Sin, a Sermon, by Henry
Sacheverell, D.D.; published at the request of the gentlemen of the
grand jury, London, 1709.” The text is, “Neither be partakers
of other men’s sins.” One extract from the sermon must suffice.
Speaking of men propagating sin by pernicious writings, he says:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do these execrable miscreants, Arius and Socinus,
though so many years rotten in their graves, still stink above
ground, and live again in a hellish transmigration of their damnable
blasphemies and heresies! How do those Atheistical monsters,
Hobbes and Spinoza, in their accursed books and proselytes,
still deny the God that made them! What a magazine of sin,
what an inexhaustible fund of debauchery and destruction does
any author of heresy, schism, or immorality, set up! Who would
have thought, threescore years ago, that the romantic and silly
enthusiasms of such an illiterate and scandalous wretch as George
Fox should, in the small compass even of our own memory, gain such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>mighty ground, captivate so many fools, and damn them with diabolical
inspiration and nonsensical cant? Or, to go higher, who
would have thought that two or three Jesuits, in masquerade,
crept into a conventicle, should sow those schismatical seeds of
faction and rebellion, that, in a few years, should rise to that prodigious
degree, as to be able to grasp the crown, contend with the
sceptre and not only threaten, but accomplish the downfall of both
Church and State? And are not the same hands at work again?
Were ever such outrageous blasphemies against God and all religion
vented publicly with impunity as at present in our own
Church and kingdom?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The sermon at St Paul’s was preached on the 5th of November
1709, and is entitled, “The Perils of False Brethren, both in
Church and State.” It is dedicated “To the Right Honourable
Sir Samuel Garrard, Lord Mayor of the City of London.” The
sermon is long, able, and eloquent; but, at the same time, rabid
and almost frantic. The following are specimens:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of the Church of England, he says: “Her holy communion
has been rent and divided by factions and schismatical
impostors; her pure doctrine has been corrupted and defiled; her
primitive worship and discipline profaned and abused; her sacred
orders denied and vilified; her priests and professors calumniated,
misrepresented, and ridiculed; her altars and sacraments prostituted
to hypocrites, Deists, Socinians, and Athiests; and all this
done, not only by our professed enemies, but, which is worse, by
our pretended friends and false brethren.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Having laid down the doctrine of “absolute and unconditional
obedience to kings in all things lawful,” he proceeds to say: “This
fundamental doctrine, notwithstanding its divine sanction, is now,
it seems, quite exploded and ridiculed out of countenance, as an
unfashionable, superannuated, nay, as a dangerous tenet, utterly
inconsistent with the right, liberty, and property of the people,
who have the power invested in them to cancel their allegiance at
pleasure, and to call their sovereign to account for high-treason
against his supreme subjects; yea, to dethrone and murder him
for a criminal, as they did the royal martyr, by a judiciary sentence.
God be thanked, these damnable positions, let them come
from Rome or from Geneva, from the pulpit or the press, are
condemned for rebellion and high-treason. Where is the difference
betwixt the power granted the people to judge and dethrone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>their sovereigns for any cause they think fit, and the no less
usurped power of the Pope to solve the people from their allegiance,
and to dispose of sceptres and diadems whenever he thinks
it his interest to pluck them from his enemies? If such a deposing
power is to be intrusted into the hands of mortals, less inconvenience
will ensue in placing it in one than in many. Our
crown and constitution can never be safe under such precarious
dependencies and despotic imaginations. A prince will be the
breath of his subjects’ nostrils, to be blown in or out at their
caprice and pleasure, and a worse vassal than the meanest of his
guards. Such villainous and seditious principles as these, demand
a confutation from that government they so insolently threaten
and arraign, and are only proper to be answered by that sword
they would make our princes bear in vain, by the so long-called-for
censure of an ecclesiastical synod, and the correction of a
provoked and affronted legislature, to whose strict justice and
undeserved mercy I commit both them and their authors.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, speaking of the Dissenters, he designates them “filthy
dreamers, presumptuous and self-willed men, despisers of dominion,
who are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, and who
wrest the Word of God to their own destruction.” He adds:
“These false brethren in our government are suffered to combine
into bodies and seminaries, where Atheism, Deism, Tritheism,
Socinianism, with all the hellish principles of fanaticism, regicide,
and anarchy, are openly professed and taught, to corrupt and
debauch the youth of the nation. Certainly the toleration was
never intended to indulge and cherish such monsters and vipers
in our bosom, that scatter their pestilence at noon-day, and will
rend, distract, and confound the firmest and best settled constitution
in the world. It is true, that since these sectarists and sanctified
hypocrites have found out a way to swallow not only oaths
but sacraments, to qualify themselves to get into places and preferments,
they can put on a show of loyalty and seem tolerably
easy in the government; but let her Majesty reach out her little
finger to touch their loins, and these sworn adversaries to passive
obedience and the royal family shall fret themselves, and curse
their Queen, and their God, and shall look upwards.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of the comprehension scheme of Archbishop Tillotson,
he says, “This latitudinarian, heterogeneous mixture of all persons
of what different faith soever, uniting in Protestancy, would render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>the Church of England the most absurd, contradictory, and
self-inconsistent body in the world. This spurious and villainous
notion, which will take in Jews, Quakers, Mohammedans,
and anything as well as Christians, our false brethren have made
use of to undermine the very essential constitution of our Church.
Her worst adversaries must be let into her bowels under the holy
umbrage of sons. To admit this religious Trojan horse, big with
arms and ruin into our holy city, the strait gate must be laid
quite open; and the pure spouse of Christ must be prostituted
to more adulterers than the scarlet whore in the Revelations.
This was indeed a ready way to fill the house of God with pagan
beasts instead of Christian sacrifices. Our Church would have
been ruined by the blasted and long-projected scheme of these
ecclesiastical Ahithophels; a scheme so monstrous, that even the
sectarists of all sorts laughed at it as ridiculous and impracticable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let the Dissenters, those miscreants, begot in rebellion, born
in sedition, and nursed up in faction, enjoy the indulgence the
Government has condescended to give them; but let them also
move within their proper sphere, and not grow eccentric, and, like
comets that burst their orb, threaten the ruin and downfall of
our Church and State. They tell us they have relinquished the
principles as well as the sins of their forefathers; but, if so, why
do they not renounce their schism, and come sincerely into our
Church? Why do they still pelt the Church with more blasphemous
libels, and scurrilous lampoons, than were ever published
in Oliver’s usurpation? Have they not lately villainously divided
us with knavish distinctions of High and Low Churchmen? Are
not the best characters they give us those of Papists, Jacobites,
and conspirators?”</p>

<p class='c001'>This firebrand sermon was delivered before the Lord Mayor
and Corporation of London, in St Paul’s Cathedral, on the 5th of
November 1709. The magistrates and common-councilmen gave
thanks to the thundering preacher; the discourse was printed,
and above 40,000 copies distributed throughout the kingdom.
Parliament met on the 15th of the same month, and the House of
Commons at once passed a resolution to the effect, that this sermon,
and also another, which on the 15th of August previous
Sacheverell had preached at Derby Assizes, “were malicious,
scandalous, and seditious libels, highly reflecting upon her Majesty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and her Government, the late happy Revolution, and the Protestant
succession, as by law established;” and ordered that Dr Henry
Sacheverell should attend at the bar of the House. Accordingly,
on December 14th, Sacheverell went to Westminster, where he
was met by a hundred of the most eminent clergymen then resident
in and about the capital, including the Queen’s own chaplains.
The doctor was taken into custody, and impeached at the
bar of the House of Lords of high crimes and misdemeanours.
After being kept in custody for a month, he was on the 13th of
January 1710, admitted to bail. The trial was fixed for February
27th, and the Commons resolved to be present as a committee of
the whole House, and a place was prepared for them accordingly
in Westminster Hall. The articles of impeachment were four in
number, and were urged by the chief members of her Majesty’s
Government; while Sacheverell had a council of five gentlemen
employed in his defence. When the legal advisers on both sides
had said all that they had to say, the doctor was permitted to
speak for himself. The scene was immensely imposing. The
trial lasted for a period of more than three weeks, from February
27th to the 23d of March. The greatest excitement prevailed
both in town and country. It was given out boldly, and in
all places, that the Dissenters were about to recover their old
ascendancy; that a design was formed by the Whig Government
to pull down the Church; that the prosecution of Sacheverell
was only to try their strength, and that upon their success in it
they would proceed to their object openly and fearlessly. The
clergy generally espoused Sacheverell as their champion, and
used their pulpits in his defence. Many places were full of riot,
and little was heard throughout the country except the old war-cry
of the Church in danger. In London there was every day a
prodigious mob of butchers’ boys, chimney-sweepers, scavengers,
costermongers, and prostitutes; and the more respectable class
of the citizens began to apprehend that all this drinking and
rioting might end in robbing, maiming, and murdering. In Westminster
Hall, near the throne, was a box, where the Queen sat,
an interested listener, in a private character; one platform was
raised for the managers of the impeachment, and another for the
doctor and his counsel. On one side of the hall, benches were
erected for the Commons of Great Britain; and, on the other,
accommodations were provided for noble ladies and gentlewomen;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>while, at the end, were galleries for the people in general. When
Sacheverell left the hall, on the first day of his trial, to return to
his comfortable and well-stocked lodging in the Temple, a countless
mob that had stood shouting, during the proceedings in Palace
Yard, followed him with tremendous huzzas; the streets were
thronged; people of both sexes saluted him from balconies and
windows; while the doctor pompously returned these compliments
from the chair in which he was being carried, and bowed and
nodded like a Chinese mandarin. On the second day of the trial,
the mob began to plunder and to burn the Dissenters’ meeting-houses.
The first attack was upon Mr Burgess’s chapel. The
pulpit and pews were pulled in pieces; and cushions, Bibles,
benches, curtains, sconces, and everything else combustible, were
carried into Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and set on fire, amid shouts of
“High Church and Sacheverell! Sacheverell and High Church!”
Five or six other chapels were similarly destroyed. Bishop
Burnet’s house was threatened, and a man standing at the door
had his skull cleft with a spade, because he refused to shout,
“The Church and Sacheverell;”<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a> but a detachment of the
Guards was called out and the mob dispersed.</p>

<p class='c001'>As already stated, when the Commons had gone through their
charges, and the counsel for Sacheverell had spoken in his defence,
he was allowed to speak for himself. It was a noticeable fact,
however, that the speech which Sacheverell recited differed so
widely from the style of his sermons and other productions, that
it was evidently the work of another. The author of Knight’s
History of England, thinks it probable that Sacheverell was
assisted in it by the learning of Dr Smalridge and Dr Atterbury,
both of whom stood by his side during nearly the whole of his
lengthened trial; and others have suspected that, because of the
help thus afforded, Sacheverell, by his will, bequeathed Atterbury
a legacy of £500. It so happens, however, that all this speculation
is beside the mark, for John Wesley most emphatically
declares that Sacheverell’s defence was written “by the rector of
Epworth,” his father.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a> If we are asked for farther evidence of
this, we have none to give. John Wesley, without doubt, had the
information from his father, and both he and his father, we trust,
are above the suspicion of being capable of giving utterance to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>statement which they knew to be a lie. There was nothing to
induce either Wesley or his father to claim the paternity of Sacheverell’s
defence, if such paternity had not been a fact; and even
if circumstances had existed to render it an honourable distinction
to be recognised as the author of such a production, John
Wesley and his father were among the last men in the world to
attempt to secure honour by dishonourable means. Personally
we should rejoice if the authorship belonged to Smalridge, Atterbury,
or any one sooner than to Samuel Wesley; but, after the
explicit declaration of his son, we are <em>forced</em> to the belief that
Sacheverell’s defence was a defence which Wesley wrote for Sacheverell
to recite. We regret this for a twofold reason; first, because
Sacheverell, however able, was a turbulent priest, not worthy
of the help of such a man as the rector of Epworth was; and,
secondly, because it proves that Wesley, who began his ministerial
life as a moderate Churchman, and an admirer of Archbishop
Tillotson, was now a partisan of the High Church clique, and
allied with men who regarded the Dissenters with the bitterest
hostility. It is true that considering the treatment which Wesley
had received from his old friends, the Dissenters, during the last
six years, there is no need to be surprised at this; and yet, at
the same time, it is a fact which the writer cannot but deplore.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sacheverell’s defence lies before us,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a> but it is scarce worth quoting.
He remarks that the charges against him are very serious;
and, for that reason, ought to be sustained by the clearer proofs;
whereas all that had been adduced had been “intendments, unnecessary
implications, strained constructions, broken sentences,
and independent passages.” In reference to the first article of
impeachment, that he had reflected upon the late revolution, and
suggested that the means to bring it about were odious and unjustifiable,
he asserts that he did not apply his doctrine of non-resistance
to the Revolution; and then contends that so far as the
doctrine itself is concerned, it is in perfect accordance with the
teachings of the apostles and of the Christian fathers, with the
laws of the kingdom, and with the homilies and articles of the English
Church. In answer to the second article, that he had defamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the Dissenters, and cast scurrilous reflections upon those who
favoured and defended liberty of conscience, he admits that he
had spoken with some warmth against hypocrites, Socinians, and
Deists; but he also contends that he had declared his approval of
the indulgence granted to the Dissenters by the law of toleration.
As to the third article, that he had said the Church was in danger
under her Majesty’s administration, he denies it altogether; but,
at the same time says, that the Church is in danger from the profaneness
and immorality, the heresies and schisms of the kingdom;
for “never were the ministers of Christ so abased and
vilified, and the Divine authority of the Scriptures so arraigned
and ridiculed; never were infidelity and atheism so impudent and
barefaced as they are at present.” In reference to the fourth
article, that he had reproachfully called those, whom the Queen
had promoted to high stations in Church and State, spurious and
false brethren, he contends that he was as loyal as any man among
them, and that his sermons and his whole behaviour proved it.
He concluded by declaring that, “whether he was acquitted or
condemned, he should always pray for the Queen his sovereign,
their lordships, his judges, and the Commons, his accusers; and
he trusted that God would deliver them from all false doctrine,
heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart and contempt of His
Word; from envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The result of this remarkable trial was, that, on March 20th,
sixty-eight members of the House of Lords found Dr Sacheverell
guilty of the high crimes and misdemeanours charged against him
by the impeachment of the House of Commons; and fifty-two
found him not guilty. Three days after, his sentence was pronounced,
to the effect that he should not preach during the three
years next ensuing; and that his two printed sermons referred to
in the impeachment, should be burnt before the Royal Exchange,
on March 27th, by the hands of the common hangman, in the
presence of the Lord Mayor of London, and of the Sheriffs of
London and Middlesex.</p>

<p class='c001'>This mild sentence was looked upon by the friends of Sacheverell
rather as an acquittal than as a condemnation; and, on
that and the following nights, bonfires illuminated the streets of
London and Westminster; there was a deluge of ale and beer,
and all who passed were compelled to drink the health of the
glorious Sacheverell. As for the doctor himself, he was now a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>greater man than ever. He returned from Westminster Hall in a
grand ecclesiastical triumph. Wherever he went, he was followed
by a prodigious train of butchers’ boys, link boys, and the like,
who made the welkin ring with their enthusiastic shouts. His
health was drunk in bumpers at festive gatherings innumerable;
and even handkerchiefs and fans were embellished with his portrait.
In the month of May, he began his triumphal progress
through the kingdom, and was looked upon as another Hercules
of the church militant. Wherever he went, his emissaries were
sent before him with his portrait; pompous entertainments were
made for him; and a mixed multitude of clergymen and sextons,
country singers and fiddlers, a mob of all conditions, male and
female, crowded together to meet and welcome him. At Exeter,
the rabble made bonfires, and broke the windows of a dissenting
meeting-house. At Oxford, Hoadley’s effigy and books were
burned. At Sherborne, some of the mob drank Sacheverell’s
health, on their knees, in the Town Hall, in the church, and on
the church steeple; while others paraded the town, with a drum,
cursing the Presbyterians and firing at their houses. At Pontefract,
the crowd battered the dissenting chapel, and thought it a
high honour to have their children christened Sacheverell. At
Gloucester, they kindled bonfires, rang the church bells, and drank
Sacheverell’s health, with damnation to Dissenters. At Cirencester,
they placed the effigy of King William on a diminutive horse,
which they made to throw it, in remembrance of the fate that
hastened the king’s death, and then threw the effigy into a fire.
They also had a cock-fight, calling one of the fowls Burgess, and
the other Sacheverell; but after a lengthened and hard battle,
cock Burgess unfortunately killed cock Sacheverell.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a> At Bridgenorth,
Sacheverell was met by four thousand men on horseback,
and as many on foot, wearing white knots, edged with gold. The
hedges, for two miles, were dressed with garlands, and the church
steeples covered with streamers, flags, and colours.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a> This clerical
progress was made after the dissolution of the Whig parliament,
and during the turbulence of a new election, and hence its motives,
successes, and excesses may be imagined. The University of Oxford
held a feast to welcome the champion of the Church. The
stately mansions of the Tory nobility were thrown open at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>approach; and, in several towns, he was received by the mayors
and magistrates in their formalities. The avenues to these towns
were lined with spectators, the hedges and trees were hung with
garlands of flowers; flags were displayed on the church steeples;
and the air resounded with cries of “Sacheverell and the Church.”
After a few weeks, however, sobriety began to return; the doctor’s
picture was frequently torn in pieces, and, in many places, he
himself was rudely treated. Sacheverell had done his work,
and had, more than any other cause, helped the Tories back to
their seats of office. In 1713, the Queen presented him to the
valuable rectory of St Andrew’s, Holborn. The first sermon
which he preached in the church of that parish, he sold for £100,
and forty thousand copies of it were speedily bought by eager
purchasers. After this, he gradually dwindled into insignificance,
and signalised himself only, during the remainder of his life, by
contemptible squabbles with his parishioners. He died at the
age of fifty-two, in 1724. “He was,” says Bishop Burnet, “a
bold, insolent man, with a very small measure of religion, virtue,
learning, or good sense; but he forced himself into popularity
and preferment by the most petulant railings at Dissenters and
Low Churchmen!” Daniel Defoe says of him, “Bear-garden
language is his peculiar talent. He is known in his books as
a pulpit incendiary; the Church’s bloody standard-bearer; the
trumpeter sent out by High Church authority to preach against
union, to proclaim open war between parties, and to hang out
flags of defiance.”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“High Church buffoon, and Oxford’s stated jest,
A noisy, saucy, swearing, drunken priest.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Such was the man whom Samuel Wesley helped in an emergency.
We are sorry to register such a fact, but truth and honesty
compel us. The only excuse which can be suggested is, that
during the last few years, the rector of Epworth had been a
serious sufferer from dissenting hatred, and that his old dissenting
friends were now his bitterest enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The new parliament met on the 25th of November 1710, and
the Queen, in her opening speech, showed that she was in the
hands of new advisers. She no longer condescended to use the
word toleration, but, spoke of <em>indulgence</em> to be allowed “to
scrupulous consciences.” This term of <em>indulgence</em> was the more
observed, because it was the pet word of Sacheverell, who held,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>that whatever liberty of conscience Dissenters had, was a matter
of indulgence, and not of right. The Whigs were now in a minority,
and the Tories were the ruling power.</p>

<p class='c001'>Convocation, of course, met on the same day as parliament, and
of this ecclesiastical synod Samuel Wesley was a member; an
honour perhaps awarded him for the service which, at the beginning
of the year, he had rendered to Sacheverell. The clergy of
the Lower House chose Dr Atterbury, Dean of Carlisle, for their
prolocutor; and then came down a royal rescript, very different
to that to which they had of late years been accustomed, a licence
empowering convocation to enter upon such consultations as the
present state of the Church required. The subjects to be discussed
were,—1. The late excessive growth of infidelity, heresy, and profaneness;
2. Excommunications, and abuses of commutation
money; 3. The visitation of prisoners, and the admission of converts
from the Church of Rome; 4. Rural Deans; 5. The glebes
and tithes belonging to benefices; 6. Clandestine marriages. As
usual, the two houses were at constant variance with each other.
Most of the winter was spent in discussing the heresies of Whiston’s
“Primitive Christianity Revived.” This learned, ingenious,
but eccentric man had succeeded Sir Isaac Newton, in 1703, at
Cambridge, as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics; but had recently
adopted Arian principles, and published them in the book
already mentioned. For this, he was expelled from Cambridge,
and was censured by convocation. There was an endless amount
of talk; but this was the only business done, when convocation
closed on the 12th of June 1711. The House of Commons, however,
took into consideration the want of churches in London,
and the thanks of the lower house of convocation were presented
to them by the prolocutor, who also submitted a scheme
for the new churches. On the 7th of May 1711, the Commons
resolved to grant to her Majesty £350,000 for the building of
fifty new churches, and the purchasing of sites of churches,
churchyards, and ministers’ houses, in and about the cities of
London and Westminster. This magnificent scheme originated
in the convocation of which Samuel Wesley was a member; but,
of course, it was carried into effect by parliament.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the 7th of December 1711, parliament re-assembled, and
convocation as well. Convocation did nothing, except discuss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>priestly absolution and lay baptism;<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a> but parliament signalised
itself by passing the notorious “Occasional Conformity Bill,”
which had been trying to struggle into life for the last ten years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whilst Samuel Wesley was attending these sessions of convocation,
his wife was doing her utmost to supply his lack of service
among his parishioners. The following facts are taken from a
letter, dated “Feb. 6, 1711–12,” and addressed to “the Rev. Mr
Wesley, in St Margaret’s Churchyard, Westminster.”<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a> After
giving a detailed account of the manner in which she had been
led to adopt the practice of reading to and instructing her family,
Mrs Wesley proceeds to state, that the servant lad had told his
parents of these family gatherings, and they desired to be admitted.
They told others, who begged the same permission, until these
domestic congregations amounted to thirty or forty individuals.
Mrs Wesley read to them the best and most awakening sermons
she could find, and discoursed with them freely and affectionately.
The congregation still grew, until now it numbered above two
hundred, and on the Sunday before the letter was written, many
had been obliged to go away through there not being room for
them to stand.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Mrs Wesley had thus, unintentionally, become a sort of female
preacher. Why did she begin these services? She says, because
she thought the end of the institution of the Sabbath was not
fully answered by attending church unless the intermediate spaces
of time were filled up by other acts of piety and devotion;<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a> but
we incline to think there was another reason beside this. Mr
Wesley, being so much in London, required a curate to supply his
place at Epworth, and it so happened that his curate at this
period, Mr Inman, was not so efficient as was desirable. On one
occasion, when Wesley returned from London, the parishioners
complained that the curate had “preached nothing to his congregation,
except the duty of paying their debts, and behaving
well among their neighbours.” The complainants added, “We
think, sir, there is more in religion than this.” Mr Wesley replied,
“There certainly is; I will hear him myself.” The curate
was sent for, and was told that he must preach next Lord’s-day,
the rector at the same time, saying, “I suppose you can prepare
a sermon upon any text I give you.” “Yes, sir,” replied the
ready curate. “Then,” said Wesley, “prepare a sermon on Heb.
xi. 6, ‘Without faith it is impossible to please God.’” The time
arrived, and the text being read with great solemnity, the curate
began his brief sermon, by saying—“Friends, faith is a most
excellent virtue, and it produces other virtues also. In particular,
it makes a man pay his debts;” and thus he proceeded for about
fifteen minutes, when the rector clearly saw that paying debts was
the alpha and the omega of the curate’s theology. It is scarce
likely that the ministry of such a man would satisfy the enlightened
mind and religious heart of Susannah Wesley; and it is
not to be wondered at that she should try to supply its defects
by reading to her children and to two hundred of her neighbours,
on Sunday evenings, the best sermons she could find in her husband’s
library.</p>

<p class='c001'>The congregations of the rector’s wife were probably larger than
those of the rector’s curate. Inman heard of these gatherings, and
wrote to Mr Wesley, complaining that Mrs Wesley, in his absence,
had turned the parsonage into a conventicle; that the church was
likely to be scandalised by such irregular proceedings, and that
they ought not to be tolerated any longer. Mr Wesley wrote to his
wife, suggesting that she should let some one else read the sermons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>She replied that there was not a man among them that could read
a sermon without spoiling a good part of it, and that none of her
children had a voice strong enough to be heard by so many people.
The only thing that disquieted her was “presenting the prayers of
the people to God.” She had been obliged to do this, but, because
of her sex, she doubted its propriety.</p>

<p class='c001'>The curate still complained, and the rector, writing to his wife,
desired that the meetings should be discontinued. She replied
that Inman and a man called Whiteley, and one or two others, were
the only persons in the parish that had raised complaints; that
calling the meeting a conventicle did not alter the nature of the
thing; and that, notwithstanding its alleged scandal, it had been the
means of bringing more people to the church than anything else
had been, for the afternoon congregation had been increased by it
from twenty to above two hundred, which was a larger congregation
than Inman had been accustomed to have in the
morning; some families who seldom went to church now began to
go constantly; and one person, who had not been there for seven
years, was now attending with the rest. Besides all this, the meetings
had been the means of conciliating the minds of the people
towards the Wesley family, and they now lived in the greatest
amity imaginable. After stating these facts, Mrs Wesley adds:—“If,
after all this, you think fit to dissolve this assembly, do not
tell me that you <em>desire</em> me to do it, for that will not satisfy my
conscience; but send me your <em>positive command</em> in such full and
express terms as may absolve me from all guilt and punishment for
neglecting this opportunity of doing good, when you and I shall
appear before the great and awful tribunal of our Lord Jesus
Christ.”<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> What the upshot was we have no means of knowing.
John and Charles Wesley were present at these irregular meetings—the
first Methodist meetings ever held—Charles a child four
years old, and John a boy of nine. “Behold how great a matter
a little fire kindleth!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XVII.</span><br />PRETERNATURAL NOISES.—1716–1717.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From the earliest times, men have believed in apparitions, or preternatural
appearances of spirits. The Jews, in the days of Moses,
were commanded not to suffer a witch to live. The Greeks and the
Romans had their demons or genii. In the days of Christ there
were demoniacs. Origen conceived that souls tainted by flagrant
crimes were either confined in a species of limbo, or attached to
particular spots, where within certain limits, they might ramble
about at pleasure. Popery, from the first, countenanced and fostered
the doctrines of witchcraft and demonology, its priests
strengthening their dominion by practising conjurations, and its
monks fabricating legends suited to the prevailing taste. Martin
Luther believed as firmly in diabolical apparitions as the most
illiterate monk in the Popish Church, which he laboured to destroy.
And, in more recent times, men like Dr Henry More, Andrew
Baxter, and Joseph Glanvil, (all contemporaneous with Samuel
Wesley,) wrote most learnedly to prove that the doctrine of apparitions
is deducible from the nature of the soul, the testimony
of Scripture, and the evidence of fact. On the other hand, most
elaborate works against the doctrine were published, about the
same period, by the celebrated Thomasius, and by Dr Balthasar
Bekker. Down to the sixteenth century, in Europe, witchcraft
universally prevailed; and even as late as the middle of the seventeenth
century it maintained its ground with considerable firmness.
In England, the belief in witchcraft was supported by the royal
authority of James I., was countenanced by Lord Bacon, and was
generally adopted among the people; and there was only one writer,
Reginald Scot, who was hardy enough to write against it. Supposed
witches were weighed against the Church Bible, which, if
the accused persons were guilty, would preponderate. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>placed in the middle of a room cross-legged, bound with cords,
and sitting on a stool; were kept without food and sleep for four-and-twenty
hours, and were watched all the while to see the witch’s
imps, in the shape of flies and spiders, come to suck her breasts.
They were made to repeat the Lord’s prayer, because no witch
could repeat it without omitting some of its sentences. A witch
could not weep more than three tears, and that only out of the
left eye. After binding the right thumb to the left toe, and the
right toe to the left thumb, the supposed witch was thrown into a
river, and, unless she sank, she was proved guilty; because, according
to the infallible teaching of King James, having renounced her
baptism by water, the water renounced her. By such trials as
these, and by the accusations of children, old women, and fools,
thousands of unhappy persons were condemned for witchcraft, and
were burnt to death. Without questioning the reality of such a
thing as witchcraft, it cannot be denied that the witnesses, by whose
evidence supposed witches were condemned, were, in most cases,
either weak enthusiasts or downright villains; and that the confessions
ascribed to the witches themselves were, in many instances,
the effects of a disordered imagination, produced by cruel
treatment and excessive watchings.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be little doubt that, from early life, Samuel Wesley
was a believer in the <a id='corr349.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='docrine'>doctrine</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_349.23'><ins class='correction' title='docrine'>doctrine</ins></a></span> of apparitions. In vol. i. of the
<cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, (p. 185,) it is assumed that the soul, after its
separation from the body, may again be clothed with some sort of
aerial, fiery, or cloudy vehicle, and be visible to our senses; and
instances are given of apparitions at Puddle Dock, London, and at
the Grange, in Lancashire. In another article of the same volume,
(p. 289,) it is said—“That spirits have sometimes really appeared
to mortals is, amongst all sober men, beyond controversy;” and
Luke xxiv. 37 is quoted in support of such a theory. In a third
article, vol. i. p. 296, ten apparition cases are related, and the
writer concludes thus:—“The next step to the disbelieving such
things is the denial of the soul’s existence out of the body; and,
if that be admitted, farewell all moral virtues and the expectation
of rewards and punishments hereafter.” Again, page 153, it is
argued that there is no nation or language in which there is not
some word expressive of the idea of witchcraft, and that, if witches
had not really existed, it was an absurd thing for Almighty God
to make a law commanding them to be put to death. Many other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>articles of a like character may be found in the other volumes of
the same work, proving, beyond a doubt, that, at the commencement
of his ministerial life, Samuel Wesley believed in witches and in
ghosts. We must now proceed to give, in as condensed a form as
possible, the account of the old Jeffrey apparition at Epworth
Parsonage. For the preservation of that account we are indebted
to the Rev. Samuel Badcock, and for its publication to
Dr Priestley.</p>

<p class='c001'>Badcock was born about the year 1750, and, at the age of nineteen,
became the minister of one of the most considerable Dissenting
congregations in Devonshire. On his removal from Barnstaple,
he was elected minister at South Moulton. He now turned his
attention to literature, and became a correspondent of the London
and monthly reviews, and of the chief London magazines. About
three years before his death, which occurred in 1788, he renounced
the Dissenting ministry, and was ordained a priest of the Established
Church.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This man, by means of Mrs Earle, the daughter of Samuel
Wesley, jun., became possessed of a large mass of Wesley MSS.,
some of which he published in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, and in
other publications of that period. The rest he gave to his friend
Dr Priestley. These included a “copy of Mr Wesley’s Diary,” and
copies of letters written by his daughters to the absent members
of the family, all in the hand-writing of Mr Samuel Wesley, jun.
This MS. was lent by Priestley to a friend, and for a time was lost;
but at length it was restored, and, in 1791, was published.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a>
Priestley, in his preface, says, “This is perhaps the best authenticated,
and the best told story of the kind, that is anywhere
extant.” The account, as published in detail by Dr Priestley,
fills forty-seven octavo pages, but every material fact will be found
in the condensed statement now subjoined.</p>

<p class='c001'>The preternatural noises at Epworth parsonage were first heard
by Mrs Wesley. This was on the evening of a day when her son
Samuel had come home from Westminster School, and, with considerable
sharpness, had quarrelled with his sister Susannah. At
the time, Mrs Wesley was in her bedroom, and heard a clattering
of doors and windows, and then several distinct knocks, three by
three. This, however, gave her no anxiety; and, though ever
after, similar noises were invariably heard previous to the occurrence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>of any family misfortune, yet Mrs Wesley, and, indeed, the
family as a whole, seemed to have attached no importance to such
disturbances until the close of the year 1716. Then the noises
became alarming, and the following is an account of them from
that period:—</p>

<p class='c001'>On the first of December 1716, Nanny Marshall, the maid-servant,
heard, at the dining-room door, something which sounded
like the groans of a dying man, and which made her hair stand on
end. This was in the day-time, and, at night, Miss Susannah and
Miss Anne Wesley, whilst sitting in the dining-room, heard something
rush on the outside of the doors that opened into the garden,
then three loud knocks, immediately after other three, and, in
half a minute, the same number above their heads. A night or
two after, Emilia came down stairs, at ten o’clock, to wind up the
timepiece and lock the doors, as usual, and, as she was doing so,
she heard, under the staircase, a sound as if some bottles there had
all been dashed to pieces; but, when she looked, all was safe.
She also heard a noise, like a person throwing down a vast coal
in the middle of the front kitchen; but when she and Susannah
went to see what it was, the dog was fast asleep, and nothing out
of order. Emilia now went to bed, but Mehetabel, who always
waited for her father to leave his study and to retire to rest, was
sitting on the lowest step of the garret stairs, when there came
down the stairs behind her, something like a man in a loose night-gown
trailing after him, which made her fly to Emilia in the nursery.
After this, the man-servant, whose dormitory was the
garret, heard some one rattling by his side, and then walking up
and down the stairs, gabbling like a turkey-cock. Noises, also,
were heard in the nursery, and all the other chambers, knocking
first at the foot of the beds, and then behind them.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length the four young ladies, Emilia, Susannah, Mehetabel,
and Anne, the youngest of whom was fourteen years of age, and
the eldest twenty-four, told their father and mother of the noises
they had heard. The father smiled, and gave no answer; but,
appearing to think it was a trick played by themselves, or by their
lovers, he afterwards took care to see them all in bed before he
went to bed himself. The mother said she believed that the noise
was made by rats; and sent for a horn to frighten them away.
At last, on December 21st, the noises were heard not only by the
young ladies, but by their parents. Nine distinct and loud knocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>startled them in the room adjoining that in which they were
sleeping. The rector thought, or was pleased to say, it might be
some one outside the house, and expressed a hope that his stout
mastiff might rid them of the disturber of their peace. Next night,
however, he heard six knocks more; and two days after, at seven
in the morning, Emilia brought her mother into the nursery, where
she heard noises under the bed, and then at the head of it. She
knocked, and it answered her. She looked beneath the bed, and
thought she saw something run from thence in the shape of a
badger, and apparently take refuge under Emilia’s petticoats. The
next night but one, Mr Wesley and his wife were awaked, shortly
after midnight, by noises so violent that it was in vain to think of
sleep while they continued. They went into every chamber; and,
generally, as they entered one room, the noise was heard in the
room behind them. Proceeding to the lower part of the house,
they heard a clashing among the bottles, and then another distinct
sound, as if a peck of money were poured out at Mrs Wesley’s
waist, and ran jingling down her night-gown to her feet. Going
through the hall into the kitchen, the mastiff came whining towards
them, and seemed almost paralysed with fear. They still
heard it rattle and thunder in every room above and behind them
except the study, where, up to the present, it had never entered.</p>

<p class='c001'>On December 26th, a little before ten at night, it began
knocking in the kitchen, then seemed to be at the bed’s foot,
then under the bed, and at last at the head of it. Mr Wesley
went down stairs and knocked with his stick against the kitchen’s
joists, and it answered him as often as he knocked. He went up
stairs, and he found it still thumping, sometimes under the bed,
and sometimes at the bed’s head. All the children were awake
and trembling with fear. He asked it what it was, and why it
disturbed innocent children and did not come to him in his study,
if it had anything to say to him; but the only response was a
knock on the outside of the house, with which the disturbance of
the night was ended.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next night the noises were as boisterous as ever; and, the
night after, when the Rev. Mr Hoole, of Haxsey, was with them,
the knocking again began upstairs, and then in the rooms below.
The two clergymen went into the kitchen, and then the sound was
in the room above. They went up the narrow stairs, and then
heard as it were the rustling of a silk night gown. Quickly it was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>the nursery, at the bed’s head, knocking three by three. Mr Wesley,
observing that the children, though asleep, were sweating and
trembling, became angry, and, pulling out a pistol, was about to
fire at the place whence the sounds proceeded; but Mr Hoole
caught him by the arm and said, “Sir, if this is something preternatural
you cannot hurt <em>it</em> by firing your pistol, but you may give
it power to hurt <em>you</em>.” He then put aside his pistol, and went
close to the place where the sounds were issuing and said, “Thou
deaf and dumb devil, why dost thou frighten children that cannot
answer thee? Come to <em>me</em> in my study that am a man.” Instantly
it knocked <em>his</em> knock, (the particular knock he always used
at his own gate and door,) as if it would shiver the board in pieces,
and away it went.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Up to this time, there had been no disturbance in Mr Wesley’s
study; but the next evening, as he opened the door, it was thrust
back with such violence as well nigh threw him down, and presently
there was a knocking, first on one side, then on the other.
His daughter Ann was in the room adjoining and he went to her,
and, as the noise still continued, he adjured it to speak, but in vain.
He then said, “Spirits love darkness; put out the candle and perhaps
it will speak.” Anne did so, and he repeated his adjuration,
but still there was only knocking, and no articulate sound. He
then said to his daughter, “Nancy, two Christians are an over-match
for a devil; go down stairs, and it may be, when I am left
alone, it will have courage enough to speak.” When she was gone
the thought occurred to him that something might have happened
to his son Samuel, and he said, “If thou art the spirit of my son
Samuel, I pray knock three knocks, and no more.” Immediately
all was silence, and the rest of the night passed away in quietude.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From this time until January 24, 1717, a period of twenty-seven
days, the house was quiet; but on this day, in the morning,
while at family prayers, the family heard the usual knocks at the
prayer for King George; and at night the knocks were more distinct,
both in the prayer for the king and for the prince, and were accompanied
with a thundering thump at the <em>Amen</em>. Between nine and
ten o’clock, while Robert Brown was sitting by himself at the back
kitchen fire, something came out of the copper hole like a rabbit,
and turned five times swiftly round. Robert ran after it with the
tongs, but, to Robert’s terrible dismay, it vanished.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>On the day after, January 25, Mr Wesley shortened the family
prayers in the morning, omitting the confession, the absolution,
and the prayers for the king and prince, and observed that whenever
he did this there was no knocking; but whenever he used the
name of King George it seemed a signal for the knocking to commence.
This made Wesley so angry that he resolved to say three
prayers for the royal family, instead of two.</p>

<p class='c001'>Emilia often heard something like the quick winding up of a
jack at the corner of her room. When Mrs Wesley stamped on
the floor it answered her; and when little Kezzia, only six years
old, did the same, three loud and hollow knocks were the immediate
response. On one occasion, when the man-servant went into
the dining-room, something like a badger, without a head, was
sitting by the fire, and ran past him through the hall. He followed
with a candle and searched, but nothing could be found.
On another occasion, to Mr Wesley’s no small amazement, his
trencher began dancing on the table where the family were dining.
Several nights the latch of his bed-room door was lifted; and one
night, when the latch of the back kitchen-door was often lifted,
Emilia went and held it fast, but it was still lifted up and the door
pushed violently against her, though nothing was to be seen outside.
Thrice Mr Wesley was pushed by an invisible power, once against
the corner of his desk, a second time against the door of the matted
chamber, and a third time against the frame of his study door.
He often spoke to it to tell him what it was, but never heard any
articulate voice, and only once or twice two or three feeble squeaks.
As a rule, as soon as the noises began the wind rose, and whistled
loudly round the house. It commonly commenced the disturbance
at the corner of the nursery ceiling, and, before it came into any
room, the latches were frequently lifted up, the windows clattered,
and whatever iron or brass was about the chamber rung and jarred
exceedingly. Very often the sound seemed to be in the air in the
middle of a room. Though it often seemed to rattle down the
pewter, to clap the doors, draw the curtains, and kick Robert
Brown’s shoes about, yet nothing was moved except the latches;
unless once, when the nursery-door was thrown open. It is also
a remarkable circumstance that the noise never came by day till
Mrs Wesley ordered the blowing of the horn; ever after that it
almost invariably happened that whenever any member of the
family went from one room into another, the latch of the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>they went to was lifted up before they touched it. It also never
came into Mr Wesley’s study until he talked to it so sharply, and
called it a deaf and dumb devil. Mrs Wesley desired it not to
disturb her from five to six o’clock in the morning; and, from that
time, no noise was heard in her chamber from five till she came
down stairs, nor at any other time when she was employed in
devotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man-servant, Robert Brown, who slept in the garret, was
often so frightened, that he ran down stairs, almost naked, not
daring to stay alone to put on his clothes; and the maid-servant,
Nanny Marshall, seemed more affrighted than anybody else.
Once, when Mary Wesley was by herself in the dining-room, the
door seemed to open, and some one entered in a night-gown trailing
upon the ground, went leisurely around her, and vanished. A
few nights after, Mr Wesley ordered her to light him to his study,
and just as he unlocked the door, the latch was lifted for him.
When Anne Wesley came into her chamber in the day-time, it
commonly walked after her from room to room, and followed her
from one side of the bed to the other. When five or six of them
were sitting in the nursery together, a cradle seemed to be violently
rocked in the room above, though no cradle existed there. One
night, when Anne was sitting on the press bed, playing at cards
with some of her sisters, the bed was lifted up. She at once
leaped down, exclaiming, “Surely old Jeffrey would not run away
with <em>her</em>.” At her sisters’ persuasion, she again sat down, when
the bed was again lifted up, a considerable height, several times
successively. The servant-maid, after churning, on one occasion,
took her butter into the dairy, and had no sooner done so than
she heard a knocking on the shelf, first above and then below.
She took a candle and made diligent search, but finding nothing,
threw down butter, tray, and all, and ran away for her very life.
Robin Brown, one night, resolved to be a match for “old Jeffrey,”
and took the large household dog to bed with him; but, despite
the dog, the latch began to jar as usual, the turkey-cock
to gobble, and the boots and shoes to clatter; until the dog, as
much frightened as Robin was, crept into bed to him, and commenced
such a howling and barking, that the whole family were
alarmed. On another occasion, Robin was grinding corn in
the garrets, and happening to stop a little, the handle of the mill
began to turn with the utmost swiftness. Robin said, “Nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>vexed him, but that the mill was empty. If corn had been in it,
old Jeffrey might have grinded his heart out for him; he would
never have disturbed him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At length, the family became so accustomed to the noises, that
they scarce regarded them. At nights, when the tapping at their
beds began, the young ladies would say, “Jeffrey is coming: it is
time to sleep;” and, in the day-time, when the noise was heard,
little Kezzy, six years old, would run up stairs, and pursue it from
room to room, saying, she wished for no better fun. Several
gentlemen and clergymen advised Mr Wesley to quit the house;
but his invariable answer was, “No; let the devil flee from <em>me</em>;
I will never flee from <em>him</em>.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>About the middle of February 1717, there seems to have been
a cessation of those unearthly noises; hence Mr Wesley wrote to
his son Samuel as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'><i>Feb. 11, 1716–7.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sam.</span>,—As for the noises, &amp;c., in our family, I thank
God, we are now all quiet. There were some surprising circumstances
in that affair. Your mother has not written you a third
part of it. When I see you here, you shall see the whole account,
which I wrote down. It would make a glorious penny book for
Jack Dunton; but, while I live, I am not ambitious for anything
of that nature. I think that is all, but blessings from—your loving
father,  <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Sam. Wesley</span>.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This, however, was far from being the last of old Jeffrey’s tricks.
At the end of March following, it made Mr Wesley’s trencher
dance upon the table;<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a> and, on the 31st of that month, after midnight,
it opened the dining-room door, where Emilia and the servant-maid
were sitting; then shut it; and then began to knock
as usual.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a> Indeed, thirty-four years after this, Emilia, who was
then Mrs Harper, speaks of still being visited by old Jeffrey, when
she was about to be visited by any new affliction;<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> and it is reported
that even as lately as within the last few years, the then
rector of Epworth and his family were residing in London, owing
to the repetition of the noises first heard a hundred and fifty years
ago in the world-renowned Epworth parsonage.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>But who was old Jeffrey? At first, Mrs Wesley thought it was
the spirit of one of her three sons, Samuel, John, and Charles, then
at school in London and Westminster; then she believed it to be
the rioting of rats; and, finally, she supposed it betokened the
death of her brother, Samuel Annesley, at that time resident in
India.</p>

<p class='c001'>In reply to all this, it may be stated, that the three young
Wesleys lived for many a long year after this; it was impossible
for freakish or frantic rats to perform all the tricks performed by
old Jeffrey; and, finally, the death of Samuel Annesley did not
occur until about eight years after Jeffrey began his disturbances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley, jun., made the strictest inquiries, and evidently
believed it to be a spirit, but for what purpose sent he was unable
to conjecture. He writes: “As to my particular opinion concerning
the events foreboded by these noises, I cannot, I must
confess, form any. I think, since it was not permitted to speak,
all guesses must be vain.”<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Some have suspected, that it might be all a trick performed by
the servants of the family; but then the noises were <em>often</em> heard
by the family when all the servants were present with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Susannah Wesley, and her sisters Emilia, Mary, Mehetabel,
and Anne, seem to have had no doubt that the whole affair
was supernatural; and the youngest of these five sisters was now
fourteen years of age, and therefore able to form something like a
correct opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Rev. Mr Hoole appears to have thought the same, for he
prevented Mr Wesley firing his pistol at the spirit, lest the spirit
should thereby obtain power to retaliate and injure him.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley believed that it was a messenger of Satan sent to
buffet his father, for the rash vow he made, fifteen years before,
and for his leaving his wife for a twelvemonth, because she refused
to pray for King William.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> We should not quarrel with
Mr Wesley for thinking that old Jeffrey was a messenger of Satan;
but the fact he mentions, on account of which the messenger was
sent, is to a great extent fiction, as we have already shown; and,
even were it true, to assign it as a reason for the coming of old
Jeffrey, is simply silly and absurd.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Priestley thinks the whole affair was a trick of the servants,
assisted by some of their neighbours, for the purpose of puzzling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the family, and amusing themselves;<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a> but how is such a theory
to be reconciled with the clashing of bottles beneath the stairs, the
repeated appearances of the badger without a head, the sound of
the peck of money poured from Mrs Wesley’s waist, the noises
occurring not only at night but also in the day, the invariable
thumping when Mr Wesley prayed for the king and prince, the
dancing of Mr Wesley’s trencher, his being thrice violently pushed
by an unseen power, the fact that the sound frequently seemed to
be in the air in the middle of a room, and that however much the
Wesleys tried to produce an imitation of the sound, none of them
could succeed in doing so. These are difficulties, which those who
adopt Dr Priestley’s opinion are bound satisfactorily to explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Rev. W. B. Stonehouse, author of “The History and Topography
of the Isle of Axholme,” accounts for the noises thus: he
writes:—“There is a large garret, which extends over the ceilings
of all the rooms below, and nothing can be more probable than
that some piece of machinery was fixed there, by which all the
noises were effected, and which required to be wound up before the
performances began.” This is childish. Who in Epworth, or the
neighbourhood, was able either to devise or to construct such
machinery? How was it introduced? Who set it up? Was it
invisible? Or is it likely that Samuel Wesley visited and examined
all the rooms in the house excepting this?</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Adam Clarke believed the thing to be supernatural; and
suggests that it may be accounted for by the following story,
which was related by a respectable person to himself. One night,
after the family had gone to bed, while the maid-servant was
finishing her work in the back-kitchen, she was startled by a noise,
looked up, and saw a man working himself through a trough,
which communicated between the sink-stone within and a cistern
without. Astonished and terrified, she seized the cleaver, which
lay on the sink-stone, and struck him on the head; after which
she uttered an awful shriek, and fell senseless on the floor. Mr
Wesley heard the noise, and supposing that the house was beset
by robbers, started out of bed, caught up the fire-irons of his study,
and began to throw them with violence on the stairs, calling out,
Tom! Jack! Harry! as loud as he could bawl, designing, by
this means, to scare away the thieves. Who the man was who
received the death-blow from the cleaver, or who were his accomplices,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>was never known; but the man was evidently carried off,
as footsteps and marks of blood were traced to a considerable
distance from the house, but not far enough to find out who the
villains were, nor whence they came. Dr A. Clarke fails to tell
us when this tragical event occurred.</p>

<p class='c001'>Southey says, that he is “as deeply and fully persuaded as John
Wesley was, that the spirits of the departed are sometimes permitted
to manifest themselves;” though he does “not believe in
witchcraft, and very greatly doubts the reality of demoniacal
possession.”<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a> He also asserts that many of the circumstances
connected with the disturbances at Epworth parsonage cannot be
explained by Dr Priestley’s supposition, that the whole thing was a
trick of the servants and neighbours; neither “can they be explained
by any legerdemain, nor by ventriloquism, nor by any
secret of acoustics.” And, then, having thus come to the conclusion
that the noises were supernatural, he endeavours to account
for such occurrences by saying: “It would be end sufficient, if
sometimes one of those unhappy persons who, looking through the
dim glass of infidelity, see nothing beyond this life, should, from
the well-established truth of one such story, be led to a conclusion
that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in their philosophy.”<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And, now, though it may seem presumption for one so insignificant
as the writer to express an opinion, after stating the
opinions of men like those already quoted, yet, at the risk of incurring
such opprobrium, he ventures to assert he has thoroughly
sifted the whole history, and has read all that has been written
concerning it; and that, though he began the examination with
the strongest prejudice against the theory that the noises were
supernatural, yet, by the force of evidence, which he has been
unable to resist, he has been driven to the conclusion that the
thing was not a trick, but that the noises and other circumstances
were occasioned by the direct and immediate agency of some
unseen spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>If asked to express an opinion whether the spirit was good or
bad, the writer would say, the latter. “About a year since,” says
Emilia Wesley, “there was a disturbance at a town near us that
was undoubtedly occasioned by witches; and, if so near, why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>may they not reach us? Then, my father had, for several Sundays
before old Jeffrey came, preached warmly against consulting
those that are called cunning men, which our people are given to;
and it had a particular spite at my father.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If asked again, What good end was to be answered by permitting
such supernatural disturbances? the writer answers, that his
own opinion thoroughly coincides with Southey’s, already given.
It is worse than absurd to suppose that God permits such occurrences
to happen without some great purpose to be accomplished;
and, for this reason, such occurrences are extremely rare. Mrs
Wesley was of this opinion, as the following extract, from an unpublished
letter to her son John, will show:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroote</span>, <i>Nov. 1724</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Jack</span>,—The story of Mr B. has afforded me many
curious speculations. I do not doubt the fact, but cannot receive
it without reason why those apparitions should come to us. If
they were permitted to speak to us, and we had strength to bear
such converse; if they had commission to inform us of anything
relating to their invisible world, that would be of any use to us in
this; if they could instruct us how to avoid any danger, or put
us in a way of being wiser or better—there would be sense in it;
but to appear for no end that we know of, unless to frighten
people almost out of their wits, seems altogether unreasonable.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>No doubt of it; and, for that reason, there was unquestionably
a great end to be answered by the supernatural noises at Epworth
parsonage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Wesley family were foreordained to exercise upon succeeding
generations, and upon mankind at large, an influence, the
effects of which are without a parallel; and, to qualify them for
such a work, it is not surprising that a more than ordinary agency
should have been employed. No man can really be in earnest in
converting sinners unless he has, not merely opinions respecting
an unseen world, but a deep and <em>felt</em> conviction that such a world
exists. The minister, without such a deep and vivid conviction,
may perform ministerial functions, but he has no anxiety about
real ministerial success. On the other hand, let the man <em>feel</em>, in
his heart and conscience, that there is a heaven, and that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>a hell, and it becomes impossible for such a man to be indifferent
respecting the souls of his fellow-men. He knows that every unconverted
sinner whom he meets is exposed to danger infinitely
more fearful than any mere earthly danger the mind can contemplate;
and hence you find in him, not merely the polite reproof,
the gentle warning, the Scripture exposition, or the perfunctory
discharge of some other ministerial duty; but you also,
find intense earnestness, which is sometimes considered fanaticism,
and almost insanity; and you likewise very often find efforts
used, and expediences employed, in converting men which shock
the refined tastes and delicate sensibilities of many who are more
politely than earnestly religious; and which from men of another
class—the avowedly profane and disbelieving—provoke contempt
and persecution. Yes; and the deeper, and more living and influential,
becomes the man’s conviction of the existence of heaven,
of hell, of angels, of devils, and of the other great certainties
of the world to come—the more impellent becomes his earnestness,
and the more excited and self-sacrificing are his labours to
turn men from sin to holiness, and from the power of Satan
unto God.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let it be granted that this is true, and then there is no difficulty
in perceiving that it was important, in the highest degree,
that a man like John Wesley should have convictions and feelings
in reference to the unseen world far stronger and deeper than
those which men, and even ministers, ordinarily have; and that
there is no need to wonder at the strange, the mysterious, the supernatural
events that happened in his father’s house; inasmuch as
the direct tendency of these events was to create, or strengthen
and intensify, the convictions and feelings already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>That such an effect was produced we have undoubted evidence.
Emilia Wesley, writing to her brother Samuel at the time, says:
“I am so far from being superstitious, that I was too much inclined
to infidelity; and I therefore heartily rejoice at having such
an opportunity of convincing myself, past doubt or scruple, of the
existence of some beings besides those we see.”<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a> This is remarkable
language for a young, educated lady, twenty-four years of
age, to use in reference to ghosts. So far from shuddering at the
thought of having heard and seen a ghost, she heartily rejoices,
because the unusual and strange occurrence had strengthened her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Scriptural belief, and convinced her, beyond a doubt, of an unseen,
vast, and eternal world.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley was at the Charter-House School, London, and
therefore was not an eye and an ear witness of the disturbances
in his father’s parsonage; but, of course, he heard of them, and
that they produced the same effect in him which they produced in
his sister Emilia, is a fact which no one can reasonably call in
question. If there be one feature more striking than another in
John Wesley’s religious character, it is his deep-rooted, intense,
animated, powerful, impelling conviction of the dread realities of
an unseen world. Without this, Wesley never would and never
could have braved so much opprobrium, endured so much suffering,
and undergone so much toil for the sole and single purpose
of saving souls. This great conviction took possession of the man,
he loved it, he cherished it, he tried to impress it upon all his
helpers and upon all his people; and the result of the whole was
the calling into action an agency, which, for earnestness of feeling,
oneness of aim, enthusiastic faith, pleading prayer, unwearied
labour, martyr courage, and spiritual success, will bear comparison
with any agency, which, in any age, it has pleased the great
Head of the Christian Church to call and use, in saving sinners
from the agonies of bottomless perdition.</p>

<p class='c001'>“With my latest breath,” says John Wesley, “will I bear testimony
against giving up to infidels one great proof of the invisible
world, I mean that of witchcraft and apparitions, confirmed by
the testimony of all ages.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a> The English in general, and indeed
most of the men of learning in Europe, have given up all account
of witches and apparitions as mere old wives’ fables. I am sorry
for it; and I willingly take this opportunity of entering my
solemn protest against this violent compliment, which so many
that believe the Bible pay to those who do not believe it. I owe
them no such service. I take knowledge, these are at the bottom
of the outcry which has been raised, and with such insolence
spread throughout the nation, in direct opposition not only to the
Bible, but to the suffrage of the wisest and best of men in all ages
and nations. They well know (whether Christians know it or not)
that the giving up of witchcraft is, in effect, giving up the Bible;
and they know on the other hand, that, if but one account of the
intercourse of men with separate spirits be admitted, their whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>castle in the air—Deism, Atheism, Materialism—falls to the
ground. I know no reason, therefore, why we should suffer even
this weapon to be wrested out of our hands. It is true that there
are numerous arguments besides this which abundantly confute
their vain imaginations, but we need not be hooted out of one;
neither reason nor religion requires this. One of the capital objections
which I have known urged over and over is, ‘Did you
ever see an apparition yourself?’ No, nor did I ever see a murder;
yet I believe there is such a thing. The testimony of unexceptionable
witnesses fully convinces me both of the one and the
other.”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This was the opinion, not of a young enthusiast, but of a scholar,
a Christian, a minister, and an author, now in the sixty-sixth year
of his age. John Wesley has been censured for his credulity;
but did he merit this? I doubt it. Southey says that “he invalidated
his own authority by listening to the most absurd tales
with implicit credulity, and recording them as authenticated
facts.”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In reply, I venture to assert that Wesley never contended for
anything but what Southey himself admits in the passage from
his writings, already quoted—viz., that “the spirits of the departed
are sometimes permitted to manifest themselves,” and that
the reason why such apparitions are permitted or ordered, is to
convince “those unhappy persons, who looking through the dim
glass of infidelity, see nothing beyond this life, that there are more
things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in their philosophy?”
This admits all that John Wesley argued for. Besides, it must be
borne in mind, that though John Wesley inserts not a few “strange
accounts” of apparitions, &amp;c., in his journals and in his magazine,
it is not true that he says he believed them all. He simply relates
some as they had been related to himself, and leaves the reader to
form his own opinion. In reference to others, he boldly expresses
a firm belief in their truthfulness, because he had received them
on testimony the most credible; and this, be it observed, is
exactly what Mr Southey does in reference to the “strange
accounts” of the disturbances in the Epworth Parsonage; so that
if Wesley, the Reformer, deserves censure for credulity, Southey,
the poet-laureate, deserves just the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reader will excuse what, perhaps, is deemed a lengthened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>digression; but it was impossible, in a life of Samuel Wesley,
sen., to pass over the strange noises in his house, and having
related them, it would have been cowardly in the biographer to
have shrunk from expressing an opinion concerning them. My
carefully-formed opinion is, that the noises were really supernatural,
and that the end to be answered was specially to qualify
certain members of the Wesley family for the special work for
which God had fore-ordained them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This opinion may seem wild and extravagant, but it has not
been formed from prejudice or without research. The examination
was commenced with a persuasion that it would be possible to
explain all the accounts of the Epworth noises on Priestley’s supposition
that the whole affair was a clever trick, performed by Wesley’s
servants, or Wesley’s enemies, or by both united; and, indeed,
there was a secret wish in the writer’s heart that it might be so.
With Southey, however, and others, he found this to be impossible,
and hence there was nothing for it but to believe that the noises
were supernatural, and to suggest a reason for their occurrence.
This has been done as fairly and as honestly as the writer has had
ability to do it; and now, expecting to be ridiculed, he entreats
the reader not to skim the matter hastily, but to sift it for himself,
remembering John Wesley’s words:—“If but one account of
the intercourse of men with spirits be admitted, the whole castle
in the air—Deism, Atheism, and Materialism—falls to the ground”
at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that ninety-nine ghost stories out of a
hundred are fanatical fabrications, but to say that such things as
witchcraft and apparitions do not exist is, to use the words of Dr
Anthony Horneck, to play more hocus-pocus tricks with the
Holy Scriptures than, as it is alleged, the witch of Endor did in
raising the prophet Samuel. In former times men had a propensity
to believe too much, at present the propensity is to believe
too little. To philosophic unbelievers, witchcraft and apparitions
may seem impossible and absurd, but the Bible establishes the
fact that such things have existed; and never gives the least intimation
that they are not again to be permitted.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />THE LAST TWENTY YEARS—1714–1735.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Samuel Wesley was born two years after the restoration of
Charles II. He lived throughout the reigns of Charles, of James
II., of William III., and Queen Mary, of Queen Anne, and of
George I., and during the first eight years of the reign of George
II. This covers a period of English history which, in thrilling interest
and importance, is not surpassed by any other period within
the compass of English annals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Queen Anne died in the year 1714, and her death led to the
immediate accession of George, Electoral Prince of Hanover, the
great-grandson of James I. After reigning thirteen years, he was
succeeded, in 1727, by his son, George II.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last twenty years of Mr Wesley’s life were full of great
events. Lord Bolingbroke, Lord Oxford, and the Duke of Ormond,
were all impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours;
Oxford was committed to the Tower; Bolingbroke and Ormond
escaped to France, and there intrigued for the restoration of the
Stuarts. The Earl of Mar erected the standard of James, the Pretender,
son of James II., at Braemar, in Scotland, and the three
Earls of Hume, Wigtown, and Kinnoul, Lord Deskford, and
others, were arrested and laid fast in Edinburgh Castle. Mr Forster
and the Earl of Derwentwater raised an insurrection in Northumberland,
and proclaimed the Pretender, at Warkworth, with
sound of trumpet. The insurgents marched to Preston, in Lancashire,
where they relinquished their arms, and Forster, Derwentwater,
and many other persons of distinction, were taken prisoners.
The gaols of the north were filled with non-juring Protestants,
High Church divines, Popish priests and monks, Jacobite squires,
Highland chiefs, and Lowland lairds. Not a few of these were
shot in heaps, and the rest, above five hundred, were left to starve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>of hunger and of cold. Meanwhile, the Pretender himself landed
at Peterhead, made his public entry into Dundee, held a council
at Perth, and ordered the burning of all the towns, villages, corn,
and forage between Perth and Stirling,—an order which was too
terribly carried into execution, the poor inhabitants, women and
children, the aged and the infirm, being exposed to the extremities
of the season in one of the coldest winters that had been
known for many generations. Numbers of the poor sufferers
perished of cold and hunger, and mothers, with their infants at
the breast, were found dead among drifts of snow. The Pretender
ultimately made a cowardly escape to France, and the Earl of
Derwentwater, and many others, were, executed for high treason.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the meantime, George I. quarrelled with his son, the Prince
of Wales, about the christening of a baby, upon which his Royal
Highness, being arrested and ordered to quit St James’s Palace,
fixed his residence at Leicester House, which became the resort of
the disaffected of all classes, and the centre of an increasing turmoil
and intrigue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The South Sea Company Bill was passed by Parliament, and
the whole nation became intoxicated with percentages, dividends,
and transfers. The stock suddenly rose from 130 to above 1000
per cent. Bubble companies sprang up round the mighty original
like mushrooms round a rotten tree, and prospectuses were issued
for making salt water fresh, for extracting silver out of lead, for
importing asses from Spain to improve the breed of mules, for
fatting hogs, for a wheel for perpetual motion, and for a thousand
other things besides. ’Change Alley was crammed from morning
till night with dukes, lords, country squires, parsons, Dissenting
ministers, brokers, and jobbers, and men of every possible colour
and description. Even the Prince of Wales became a governor of
a Welsh Copper Company, and made a gambling profit by the
illegal transaction of not less than £40,000. The bubbles soon
burst. The South Sea stock, which sold in August at 1000, in
September sunk below 300, and in November fell down to 135.
Terrible excitement followed; disgraceful facts were published,
and thousands of persons beggared. One of the political results
was a change of government. Sunderland had to resign the
premiership, and Robert Walpole, Earl of Oxford, the high Tory,
and one of the friends of Sacheverell, became prime minister, and,
despite incessant attacks from political enemies of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>splendid talents, retained the high office for two and twenty
years.</p>

<p class='c001'>About the same time, the Polish wife of the Pretender gave
birth to a son at Rome, in the presence of seven cardinals. The
child, at a most royal christening, received the name of Charles
Edward, and the event was proclaimed by the Jacobites in all
parts of the United Kingdom. New plots against King George,
and in favour of the Pretender and his infant child, were concocted,
Bishop Atterbury being the chief of the intriguers. Atterbury
and his friends engaged to get possession of the Tower, the
Bank, and the Exchequer, and to proclaim King James III.,
simultaneously, in different parts of the country. The scheme exploded,
and Lord North, Lord Orrery, and the Duke of Norfolk
were arrested. Atterbury was brought before the Privy Council, and
was committed to the Tower. The High Church party cried aloud
against the sacrilegious arrest of a bishop. The clergy in London
and Westminster offered public prayer for him. Alexander Pope,
his bosom friend, was among Atterbury’s witnesses. The bishop
was deprived of his bishopric, and banished from his country. He
at once threw himself into the service of the Pretender, and became
his confidential agent, first at Brussels, and afterwards at
Paris. He died in exile in 1731.</p>

<p class='c001'>George I. died of apoplexy, in 1727, whilst travelling with one
of his mistresses, the Duchess of Kendal, to Hanover. At the
time, the little, beggared, and vagabond court of the Pretender was
distracted with all kinds of intrigues, jealousies, and animosities.
Atterbury continued to cabal with priests, monks, and mistresses.
James wished to make one more effort to obtain the throne of his
fathers, but Atterbury could afford him no encouragement, and
the scheme was dropped until it was revived by his son, Charles
Edward, in 1745.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal ecclesiastical events which occurred during the
decline of Mr Wesley’s life, were the censure pronounced by the
Lower House of Convocation, in 1714, upon Dr Samuel Clark’s
famous book, entitled, “The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity;”
and the bitter and long-continued controversy arising out of Bishop
Hoadley’s “Preservative against the Principles and Practices of
the Nonjurors,” in the course of which Sherlock, Potter, and
Hare took a prominent position, and not fewer than about
seventy different publications were produced.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>The social, moral, and religious condition of the country was
still far from satisfactory. Gentlemen wore tie-wigs, and, instead
of swords, carried large oak sticks, with great heads and ugly faces
carved thereon; while ladies, when walking out of doors, wore
masks, hooped petticoats, and scarlet cloaks. Places of political
resort, called mug-houses, were established in all parts of London,
where citizens and tradesmen attacked the Tories with such bitterness,
under the double inspiration of ale and patriotism, that at
length the mug-houses had to be suppressed by Act of Parliament.
Royal mistresses were maintained at court, as a state appendage,
and thereby public immorality was kept in countenance. The
mercantile classes grew in wealth, and all who were of any respectability
had the title of <em>esquire</em> appended to their names, so
that Steele complains that England had now become a nation of
esquires. The streets of London were still, for the most part, unpaved,
and the kennels on both sides were usually choked up with
all sorts of garbage. Pickpockets were numerous, and purses,
snuff-boxes, and watches disappeared with a facility incomprehensible
to the owners. The metropolis could boast of not more than
a thousand lamps, which were kept burning only till midnight,
and that for only one-half of the year. Prize fights were frequent,
the gladiators, who mangled themselves with swords and daggers
for the amusement of the crowd, subsisting upon the subscription
purses and the admittance fees. In the country, the monotonous
toils of the peasantry were enlivened chiefly by wakes and fairs,
thronged with puppet shows, pedlars’ stalls, raffling tables, and
drinking booths. Among the favourite competitions at fairs, were
grinning matches, in which the candidates grinned most hideously
through a horse’s collar; and trials in whistling, where the person
who could whistle through a whole tune without being put out by
the drolleries of a merry-Andrew that were played off before him,
was the victor. At Christmas, trials of yawning for a Cheshire
cheese took place at midnight, and he who gave the widest and
most natural yawn, so as to set the whole company agape in
sympathy, carried off the cheese in triumph. Young damsels,
anxious to know something of their future husbands, were directed
to run until they were out of breath, as soon as they heard
the first notes of the cuckoo, after which, on pulling off their shoes,
they would find in them a hair of the same colour as that of their
future mates. On May-day, a girl had only to bring home a snail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>and lay it upon the ashes of the hearth, and, in crawling about,
the reptile would mark the initial letter of her true love’s name.
It is true, that the belief in antique rites like these was fast departing,
but still such spells were practised in many a peasant’s
hut and farmer’s home long after Mr Wesley’s death.</p>

<p class='c001'>Towards the end of the reign of George I. the wages of a farm
bailiff were not above £6 a year; and of other farm-servants, from £2
10s. to £5. The wages of female servants were from thirty to fifty
shillings yearly. Masons, carpenters, and plumbers received a shilling
a day without meat, or sixpence a day with it. Wheat sold
for about five shillings a bushel, but the great bulk of the people
were too poor to purchase it. Even families that were reputed rich
used not more than a peck of wheat a year, and that was used at
Christmas. Bread loaves and pie crusts were made of barley-meal,
and puddings and dumplings, made of oatmeal and suet, were a
common dish at rural entertainments. The price of beef and mutton
was about 2½d. per pound, of butter, about 5d., and of Cheshire
cheese, about 3d.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The period which we are now sketching had a fair average of
men of genius and learning. Wake was Archbishop of Canterbury.
Kennett, an intense student, presided over the diocese of Peterborough.
Edmund Gibson, a man of great natural abilities, filled
the see of London. John Potter, the son of a Yorkshire linen-draper,
worked his way up to the primacy. Hoadley, the Bishop of
Winchester, was described as the greatest Dissenter that ever wore
a mitre. William Sherlock was writing his celebrated “Trial
of the Witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus.” Daniel Waterland
was defending the doctrine of the Trinity against the attacks
of Samuel Clarke, and the truth of revealed religion against Tindal,
the infidel. Bishop Butler was composing his “Analogy of Religion.”
Warburton was equiping himself for a diocese, and for the
writing of his “Divine Legation.” Dean Prideaux was composing
his “Connexion of the Old and New Testaments.” Bishop Lowth
was busy with his invaluable works on Hebrew poetry, &amp;c. Thomas
Stackhouse was preparing his “History of the Bible.” George
Lavington was developing the talents which he afterwards employed
in writing “The Enthusiasm of the Papists and Methodists
Compared,” and William Law, the well-known author of the “Serious
Call to a Devout and Holy Life,” had abandoned the pulpit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>and become tutor to Edward Gibbon, the father of the great historian.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among Dissenters, Edmund Calamy was preaching and writing
almost unceasingly. Isaac Watts was an inmate of Abney House, and
was composing hymns which have been sung by myriads. Nathaniel
Lardner was completing his “Credibility of the Gospel History.”
Samuel Chandler was lecturing at the Old Jewry Chapel.
Philip Doddridge had opened his Dissenting Academy at Northampton.
Daniel Neal was publishing his “History of the Puritans;”
and John Leland was answering Tindal’s “Christianity as
Old as the Creation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Belonging to other classes of distinguished men living at this
period, are Sir Isaac Newton, who, in 1727, was buried with great
magnificence in Westminster Abbey; Edmund Halley, who was
Newton’s highly respected friend; Sir Hans Sloane, who succeeded
Newton as the President of the Royal Society; Nicholas
Saunderson, the son of a Yorkshire exciseman, blind from infancy,
and yet one of the most illustrious mathematical professors that
the University of Cambridge ever had; William Emerson, who,
with a dirty wig half off his head, his shirt buttoned behind, and
inexpressibles that disdained the aid of braces, wrote books connected
with almost every branch of the science of mathematics;
Richard Bentley, the son of a Yorkshire blacksmith, who rose to
the high office of Regius Professor of Divinity, and of whom Stillingfleet
remarked, that “had he but the gift of humility, he
would be the most remarkable man in Europe;” Sir Richard
Steele, Joseph Addison, Alexander Pope, John Gay, James Thomson,
Matthew Prior, and William Congreve, may all be mentioned
in a cluster; Edward Young, whose “Night Thoughts” have immortalised
his memory; but who was a poet of high distinction
long before they were thought about, having, in 1728, received
from Wharton for his satire entitled “The Universal Passion,”
the enormous sum of £3000; Samuel Johnson, who, at the time
of Samuel Wesley’s death, was writing his first work for the press,
“Lobo’s Voyage to Abyssinia;” Allan Ramsay, who was revolving
in his mind the thoughts and charms of his “Gentle Shepherd;”
Edward Cave, the son of a shoemaker, who was now
meditating how to carry into effect his long cherished-scheme of
the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>; William Croft, who was revelling
among his musical compositions; Handel, who, in his enormous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>white wig, was putting together his unrivalled oratorios; Sir Godfrey
Kneller, who was painting heads to ready-made bodies with
inconceivable rapidity; Dahl, Richardson, Jervas, and others, who
were clothing their portraits with loose drapery, the costume of no
age or nation whatever; Hogarth, who was rising to the zenith
of his fame; and Roubiliac, whose chisel was giving to the marble
a vitality which almost breathed.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are a few of the distinguished men who flourished during
the last twenty years of Samuel Wesley’s life; and among them
he himself was not the least eminent. It was during this period
that he prepared and wrote the greatest work that proceeded from
his prolific pen, entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dissertationes in Librum Jobi—Autore,
Samuele Wesley, Rectore de Epworth in Dioecesi Lincolniensi.”</span>
The work is a large-sized folio of more than 600 pages, of good paper,
and beautifully printed. It is written in Latin, intermixed with
innumerable Hebrew and Greek quotations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was employed upon this remarkable work for more
than five and twenty years. It was first begun previous to the
burning of his parsonage, in 1709. He had carefully read the
book of Job, first in the Hebrew text, and secondly in that of the
Greek Septuagint. These he collated together, making, as he
proceeded, the notes and observations that occurred to him. He
then procured Walton’s great Polyglott Bible, containing the
Sacred Text in the Hebrew and Greek languages; the Pentateuch
in Samaritan; the Psalms and the New Testament in Syriac,
Arabic, Chaldaic, and Ethiopic; the four Gospels in Persic; together
with the Septuagint and Vulgate versions of both Testaments.
Collating what he had already done with the versions of
the book of Job in Walton’s Polyglott, he greatly increased his
notes and observations. He had proceeded thus far, when the
fire of 1709 broke out, and every leaf of his Polyglott and of his
collections on Job were utterly destroyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>He procured another Polyglott and recommenced his studies.
The Hebrew text was read over again and again. The Alexandrian
and Vatican editions of the Septuagint were diligently compared.
All the variations in the Chaldee, Arabic, and Syriac versions,
with the principal critics, as exhibited in Pool’s “Synopsis,”
together with all the fragments of Origen’s “Hexapla,” were carefully
collated. Tindal’s and the Bishop’s Bible were compared.
All the commentators within his reach were consulted. Pliny,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Salmasius, Mercator, Jerome, Eusebius, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus,
Luitsius, Sanson, Purchas, Hakluyt, De la Valle, <a id='corr372.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Pentinger'>Pentinger,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_372.1'><ins class='correction' title='Pentinger'>Pentinger,</ins></a></span>
Bochart, Calmet, Pineda, Spanheim, Hyde, Bunting, Greaves,
Sandys, Usher, Lloyd, Marshall, Reyland, and Maundrell, were
all laid under contribution to his work. Accompanied by his
son John, he visited, in 1733, the library of Lord Milton at Wentworth
House, and acknowledges that without the kindness of his
lordship, the work would have come into the world mutilated, or
would have perished as an abortion. While at Wentworth House,
their stay was prolonged over the Sabbath, and John Wesley occupied
the pulpit of Wentworth Church to the no small gratification
of the parishioners.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley also received assistance from Maurice Johnson, Esq.,
who was a distinguished antiquarian, and the founder of the
Gentleman’s Society at Spalding, of which many of the greatest
men in the nation, including Sir Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope,
Sir Hans Sloane, and Samuel Wesley, were members. Johnson
was born at Spalding, was a student of the Inner Temple, London,
married early a lineal descendant of Sir Thomas Gresham, had
twenty-six children, and was the possessor of a fine collection of
plants and medals. He was held in high esteem for the frankness
and benevolence of his character, and was always ready to communicate
the results of his literary researches to all who applied
to him for information.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> He contributed one of the maps to Mr
Wesley’s “Book of Job;” and also one of the dissertations on
“Job’s Jurisprudence.”<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Assistance was also received from Roger Gale, Esq.,<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> a gentleman
who was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge; possessed
a considerable estate at Scruton, Yorkshire, was Member of Parliament
for Northallerton, the first Vice-President of the Society
of Antiquaries, and was considered one of the most learned men
of his age. He died at Scruton, in 1744, universally esteemed,
and left all his MSS. and Roman coins to his alma mater, Cambridge
University.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was further assisted by his three sons, Samuel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>John, and Charles, who did everything in the work that dutiful
sons should do for an aged parent.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the last few years of his life, Mr Wesley suffered most
painfully from the gout and palsy, and hence found it necessary
to employ an amanuensis. Two gentlemen who were employed
in this capacity, in writing the “Dissertations on the Book of
Job,” were John Romley and John Whitelamb.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have no information of Romley’s origin, except that he
studied divinity under Samuel Wesley; graduated at Lincoln
College, Oxford; and was for a time Mr Wesley’s curate. He
was a member of the Gentleman’s Society at Spalding; and, in
1730, presented to that society an “Account of the Manors, Villages,
Seats, and Church of Althorp, in Lincolnshire.”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a> It is
also stated, in Nicholl’s “Literary Anecdotes,” that he was schoolmaster
at Wroote. Seven years after Mr Wesley’s death, he was
curate of Epworth, and refused to allow John Wesley either to
read the prayers or to preach in Epworth church, and, in Wesley’s
presence, delivered a florid and oratorical sermon on enthusiasts,
which led Wesley to preach the same evening on his father’s
tombstone to such a congregation as Epworth had never seen.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
Seven months afterwards, John Wesley preached again on the
same sacred spot, and, on asking Romley’s permission to receive
the sacrament, received as an answer, “Tell Mr Wesley I shall
not give <em>him</em> the sacrament, for he is not <em>fit</em>.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a> In August 1744,
he was again at Epworth, and heard Romley preach two sermons
so “exquisitely bitter and totally false” as he had never heard
before. In May 1745, when he was again present, Romley’s
“sermon, from beginning to end, was another railing accusation.”<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
Three years after this, Romley had lost his “soft, smooth, <a id='corr373.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='tunefu'>tuneful</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_373.29'><ins class='correction' title='tunefu'>tuneful</ins></a></span>
voice, without hope of recovery, and spoke in a manner so shocking
to hear that it was impossible for him to make himself heard
by one quarter of his congregation.”<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a> He also became a tippler,
and was sometimes “so drunk that he could scarce stand or
speak.”<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a> In 1751, he became mad, and had to be confined.
During the first week of his confinement, he was for constraining
every one that came near him to kneel down and pray; and
frequently cried out, “You will be lost, you will be damned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>unless you know your sins are pardoned.” Two or three weeks
afterwards he died.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a> Such was one of the men who helped
Samuel Wesley in the preparation of his great work, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dissertationes
in Librum Jobi.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'>The other amanuensis was John Whitelamb, who was born in
the neighbourhood of Wroote, and received the rudiments of his
education at an endowed school, established there in 1706, in
accordance with the will of Mr Travers, who bequeathed three
hundred and seventy-nine acres of land for the support of schools
at Wroote, Hatfield, and Thorne. The school was placed under
the care of Romley, who recommended Whitelamb to the notice of
Mr Wesley as a lad of promising abilities. Mr Wesley took
Whitelamb to his house at Epworth, where he became his amanuensis
in place of Romley, and, for four years, was employed in
transcribing his “Dissertations on the Book of Job;” and in
designing the illustrations for it, several of which were engraved
with his own hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the care of the Rector of Epworth, young Whitelamb
obtained a sufficient knowledge of Latin and Greek to enter the
university; and at the expense, chiefly, of Mr Wesley’s family, he
was maintained at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he obtained his
education gratis under Mr John Wesley, then a fellow of that seat
of learning. In a letter to his father, dated “June 11, 1731,”
John Wesley says: “John Whitelamb reads one English, one
Latin, and one Greek book alternately; and never meddles with a
new one in any of the languages till he has ended the old one.
If he goes on as he has begun, I dare take upon me to say, that,
by the time he has been here four or five years, there will not be
such a one of his standing in Lincoln College, perhaps not in
the University of Oxford.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs Wesley used to call Whitelamb “poor starveling Johnny,”
and no wonder; for John Wesley writing to his brother, Samuel,
a few months after the date just given, says; “John Whitelamb
wants a gown much, and I am not rich enough to buy him one at
present,”<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a> and he then states his purpose to use his influence
among his friends to beg the money requisite to make the purchase.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1733, Whitelamb became Samuel Wesley’s curate, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>married to his daughter, Mary. In one short year he became a
widower, and was so overwhelmed with grief that he wished to
get away from the scene of his sorrows, and to embark in the
contemplated mission to Georgia.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 6th of June 1742, John Wesley, being refused the use
of the Epworth church, preached standing upon his father’s tombstone.
Whitelamb, who was then the rector at Wroote, was one
of his congregation, and, five days after, wrote him a most touching
letter. He says: “I saw you at Epworth. Fain would I
have spoken to you, but that I am quite at a loss how to address
you. Your way of thinking is so extraordinary that your presence
creates awe, as if you were an inhabitant of another world. I
retain the highest veneration and affection for you. The sight of
you moves me strangely. My heart overflows with gratitude. I
feel, in a high degree, all that tenderness and yearning of bowels
with which I am affected towards every branch of Mr Wesley’s
family. I cannot refrain from tears, when I reflect this is the
man who at Oxford was more than a father to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am quite forgot. None of the family ever honours me with
a line! Have I been ungrateful? I appeal to sister Patty; I
appeal to Mr Ellison whether I have or no. I have been passionate,
fickle, a fool; but I hope I shall never be ungrateful.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dear sir, is it in my power to serve or to oblige you in any
way? Glad I should be that you should make use of me. God
open all our eyes and lead us into truth, whatever it be.</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>John Whitelamb.</span>”<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley did make use of him, for, two days after, he preached
twice in Whitelamb’s church<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a>; a circumstance which gave great
offence to the High Church party, and was likely to involve Whitelamb
in considerable trouble at the approaching triennial visitation.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley says that at this time, and for some years after,
Whitelamb did not believe the Christian revelation.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> I can hardly
understand this, unless it arose out of Whitelamb stating to Charles
Wesley that he looked upon the doctrines preached by himself and
his brother “as of ill consequence,” and that he had great reason
to think that, what he calls “the seal and testimony of the Spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>was, in the generality of their followers, merely the effect of a
heated fancy.”<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a> In the same letter, however, he speaks of John
Wesley in the kindest terms, and says—“He behaved to me truly
like himself. I found in him what I have always experienced
heretofore, the gentleman, the friend, the brother, the Christian.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Whitelamb died in July 1769,<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> and was succeeded by a member
of the Whitelamb family, who was remarkable for his various
learning, and especially for his skill in mathematics.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In 1844, there was an aged female at Wroote, who remembered
John Whitelamb, and had been a scholar in his school. She described
him as a person of retiring habits, and fond of solitude.
She was present when he was suddenly seized, on his way to perform
divine service at the church, with the illness which shortly
terminated in his death; and stated that his funeral was attended
by a considerable number of clergymen, who thus paid their last
tribute of respect to a departed friend.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a> On a small stone in the
churchyard, about two feet long and one foot broad, is the following
inscription:—<a id='corr376.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='In'>“In</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_376.18'><ins class='correction' title='In'>“In</ins></a></span> memory of John Whitelamb, Rector of this
Parish thirty-five years. Buried 29th July 1769, aged 62 years.
Worthy of imitation. This at the cost of Francis Wood, Esq.,
1772.”<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Adam Clarke says Whitelamb was a Deist; and John Wesley
says that for years he did not believe the Christian revelation.
As to Dr Clarke’s assertion, I demur to it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in toto</i></span>; and, as to Mr
Wesley’s I agree with Southey in regarding it as a hasty and loose
expression, only applicable to the peculiar—the great and glorious
doctrines—which Wesley and his band of helpers were the means
of rescuing from oblivion, and of propagating throughout the land.
Still Wesley always regarded him as a backslider, and, after his
death, exclaimed—“Oh, why did not he die forty years ago, while
he knew in whom he had believed!”<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As an apology for these lengthened remarks respecting John
Whitelamb, the reader is reminded that this able man married one
of Mr Wesley’s daughters, and, for four years, acted as his amanuensis
in transcribing his “Dissertations on the Book of Job.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley’s Dissertations are fifty-three in number, (Dr Adam
Clarke, in mistake, says thirty-five,) and many of them, besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>being immensely learned, are in a high degree interesting and

<p class='c001'>Unhappily the whole of these Dissertations are written in Latin,
and, therefore, are never likely to be read except by the lettered
few. Who will undertake to furnish a correct translation of some
of them for a periodical like the <cite>Methodist Magazine</cite>?</p>

<p class='c001'>After the Dissertations, there are nearly two hundred pages
occupied with the Hebrew text of the Book of Job, collated with
the Chaldee Paraphrase, and with the Septuagint in its best
editions; and also with the Syriac and Arabic versions; likewise
with the Latin versions of Castellio, Montanus, St. Ambrose,
Junius Tremellius, Piscator, and of the Zurich divines, together
with the English version of Tindal, and the present authorised
version. Every verse of the whole book of Job was collated
in all the versions above-mentioned, and all the variations set
down. This must have been an immense labour. Dr Adam
Clarke says—“It is one of the most complete things of the kind
I have ever met with, and must be invaluable to any man who may
wish to read the book of Job critically.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The frontispiece of Mr Wesley’s large folio is a portrait of himself
in the character of Job. He is represented as without beard,
and without whiskers; as wearing a small cap; as clothed in a
long, loose-flowing robe; and as sitting in an antique chair with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>sceptre in his hand, two pyramids being placed behind him, and
above him the arch and portcullis of an ancient gate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book is also illustrated with a most hideous picture of the
five cities of the plain, probably designed and executed by the
untutored hand of John Whitelamb; two maps of the region of
the Red Sea; another plate, pretending to represent the tombs of
Rachel, Dionysius, the Maccabees, Semiramis, and Herod the Great;
two maps of Arabia; a map of Maundell’s Journey from Aleppo
to Jerusalem; an illustration of the Borealis; together with large-sized
engravings of the hippopotamus, the crocodile, and the horse.</p>

<p class='c001'>In reference to the horse, the following anecdote is worth preserving.
It appears that Lord Oxford had in his possession, what
was supposed to be, the finest Arab horse in existence. His Lordship
had already shown great kindness to Mr Wesley’s son Samuel
at Westminster, and, thus encouraged, the rector wrote, saying he
was wishful to illustrate his Dissertations by an engraving of the
Arab horse, and that he had been told that his lordship’s “Bloody
Arab” was the finest animal of that breed that existed. He adds:—“I
have an ambition to get him drawn by the best artist we can
find, and place him as the greatest ornament of my work. If your
lordship has a picture of him I would beg that my engraver may
take a draft from it, or, if not, that my son may have the liberty
to get one drawn from life.”<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley, jun., shared the intimate friendship of this distinguished
statesman, and was a frequent guest at his lordship’s
house; and there can be little doubt that, through him, the
father’s request was granted, especially remembering that Lord
Oxford was not only a great encourager of literature, but the
greatest collector, in his time, of curious books and manuscripts,
and that he it was who formed the nucleus of the celebrated
Harleian library, now one of the richest treasures of the British
Museum.</p>

<p class='c001'>Prefixed to Mr Wesley’s Dissertations is a list of subscribers’
names, numbering more than three hundred, and including thirty-one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>nobles, fifteen bishops, and twenty-two deans and other dignitaries
of the Church. The following are some of the distinguished
names in this illustrious list, given alphabetically:—Earl of Ashburnham,
Bishop Atterbury, Lord Bathurst, Lord Bolingbroke,
Duke of Buckinghamshire, Earl of Burlington, Archbishop of
Canterbury, Bishop of London, Earl of Malton, Earl of Orrery,
Earl of Oxford, Alexander Pope, Earl of Portmore, Sir Hans
Sloane, Dean Swift, Lord Tyrconnel, Dr Waterland, Samuel, John,
Charles, and Matthew Wesley, and William Whiston. Such
names are a strong intimation of Mr Wesley’s high repute as a
literary man.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proposals for publishing the Dissertations were circulated
in 1729, but the book was not ready for the market until
about the year 1736, that being the date of a copy now before us.
The work was dedicated by permission to Queen Caroline, to
whom it was presented by John Wesley, two days before he set
sail for Georgia. He says, her Majesty received it with “many
good words and smiles.”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Dr Clarke relates that, when Wesley
was introduced into the royal presence, the Queen was romping
with her maids of honour; but she suspended her play, took the
book from his hand, and said, “It is very prettily bound,” and
then laid it down without opening it. He rose up, bowed, walked
backward, and withdrew. The Queen bowed and smiled, and immediately
resumed her sport.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Badcock, whose friendship for the Wesley family was
dubious, says, Mr Wesley’s Dissertations were “never held in any
estimation by the learned.” John Wesley replied, “I doubt that.
The book certainly contains immense learning, but of a kind which
I do not admire.”<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Bishop Warburton, of whom Dr Johnson says, “his knowledge
was too multifarious to be always exact,” writing to Bishop Hurd,
remarks: “Poor Job! It was his eternal fate to be persecuted
by his friends. His three comforters passed sentence of condemnation
upon him, and he has been executing <em>in effigie</em> ever
since. He was first bound to the stake by a long <em>Catena</em> of Greek
fathers; then tortured by Pineda; then strangled by Caryll; and
afterwards cut up by Wesley, and anatomised by Garnet. He
was ordained, I think, by a fate like that of Prometheus, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>lie still upon his dunghill, and have his brains sucked out by
owls.”<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As a set-off to Warburton’s slap-dash wit, we give a letter
which Alexander Pope addressed to Dean Swift in the year 1730:—“This
is a letter extraordinary, to do and say nothing but
recommend to you a pious and good work, and for a good and
honest man; moreover, he is about seventy, and poor, which you
might think included in the word ‘honest.’ I shall think it a
kindness done to myself, if you can propagate Mr Wesley’s subscription
for his Commentary on Job among your divines, (bishops
excepted, of whom there is no hope,) and among such as are
believers, or readers of Scripture. Even the curious may find
something to please them, if they scorn to be edified. It has been
the labour of eight years<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a>of this learned man’s life. I call him
what he is—a learned man; and I engage you will approve his
prose more than you formerly could his poetry. Lord Bolingbroke
is a favourer of it, and allows you to do your best to serve an old
Tory and a sufferer for the Church of England, though you are a
Whig, as I am.”<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Lord Oxford wrote to Swift in the same year, requesting the
same favour, and says: “The person concerned is a worthy, honest
man; and by this work of his he is in hopes to get free of a load
of debt which has hung upon him for some years. This debt of
his is not owing to any folly or extravagance, but to the calamity
of his house having been twice burned, which he was obliged to
rebuild; and having but small preferment in the Church, and a
large family of children, he has not been able to extricate himself
out of the difficulties these accidents have brought upon him.
Three sons he has bred up well at Westminster, and they are
excellent scholars. The eldest has been one of the ushers in Westminster
School since the year 1714. He is a man in years, yet
hearty and able to study many hours in a day. This, in short, is
the ease of an honest, poor, worthy clergyman; and I hope you
will take him under your protection. I cannot pretend that my
recommendation should have any weight with you, but as it is
joined to and under the wing of Mr Pope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We have now passed in review the whole of Mr Wesley’s
literary productions, excepting one. This was “A Letter to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Curate,” originally written for the use of the brother of the Rev.
Mr Hoole of Haxey, who was about to be ordained, and to become
Samuel Wesley’s curate at Epworth. A year or two after, the
manuscript was sent to John Wesley, who published it shortly
after his father’s death, and says, in his preface, that the reader
will “find strong sense and deep experience, in plain, clear, and unaffected
words, and a strain of piety running through the whole,
worthy a soldier of Jesus Christ.” This considerably-sized pamphlet
is now extremely scarce, but the reader may find a reprint
of it in an Appendix to Jackson’s “Life of Charles Wesley,”
vol. ii. p. 500. As the pamphlet throws great light upon Mr
Wesley’s character, displays his immense reading, mentions the
leading men of his times with whom he was personally acquainted,
and makes several statements respecting his own proceedings as a
parish priest, we take the liberty of giving a lengthened outline
of its valuable contents.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The points <a id='corr382.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='upon upon'>upon</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_382.17'><ins class='correction' title='upon upon'>upon</ins></a></span> which Mr Wesley gives advice to his
young curate are—1. His general aims and intentions; 2. His
converse and demeanour among the parishioners; 3. His reading
the liturgy; 4. His studies; 5. His preaching and catechising.
6. His administering the sacraments. 7. The administration of
discipline.</p>

<p class='c001'>In reference to the first, he avers that the end to be aimed at
by every Christian minister is “the glory of God, the edifying of
His Church, and the salvation of immortal souls.” The man who
makes the attainment of worldly dignity any part of his design,
falls not far short of the iniquity of Simon Magus, nor can he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>expect a much better end. Without the aim being right, a clergyman’s
life would be one of the most tasteless and wearisome things
in the world. “For my own part,” he says, “I had rather be a
porter, or even a pettifogger.” To keep the heart right in this
matter, he recommends his curate to read, once a quarter, the
form of ordination; just as Methodist preachers, some years ago,
were enjoined to read the “Liverpool Minutes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As it regards “converse and demeanour,” he strongly advises
that, when parish business calls the minister to a public-house, as
it sometimes may, his stay in such a place should be as brief as
possible; and that when visiting, especially the rich, he should
guard himself against the bottle and against bribes. He recommends
him to “visit his whole parish from house to house, and
that even the men and maid-servants; for a good shepherd knows
his sheep by name.” He advises him to take down the name and
age of every person, and to ascertain who can read; who can say
their prayers and catechisms; who have been confirmed; who
have received the communion; who are of age to do it; and who
have prayers in their families. He had attempted this twice or
thrice himself during the first twelve years of his ministry at
Epworth; but during the last twelve, since his house was burned,
he had been so much diverted, that, though he had begun such a
systematised visiting, he had not been able to quite finish it. He
recommends the curate to visit the sick, even though not requested;
and to endeavour to suppress the new custom of burying by candlelight.</p>

<p class='c001'>With regard to “reading prayers,”<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a> he expresses a confident
hope that his curate will do as he has done, viz., read the prayers
on every holiday, Wednesday, and Friday; and, he says, he should
be pleased if this was done also on the eves of holidays. He
remarks that there are but very few who read the Liturgy as it
should be read; and that he has heard a hundred good preachers
to one good reader. He says—“I am of opinion that the prayers,
and even the lessons, might be pricked, as are the psalms and
anthems, so as to be read properly and musically.” He urges his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>friend to avoid “unequal cadences,” and “incondite whinings;
laying weight where there ought to be none, or omitting it where
it is requisite, like the music of a Quakers’ meeting.” “He must,”
he adds, “avoid a running over the prayers, as if we were in haste
to be at the end of them; and, on the other side, a drawling,
canting manner, either of which will be apt to render the reader,
if not the prayers themselves, contemptible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting psalmody, he says that, as they cannot, at Epworth,
“reach anthems and cathedral music, they must be content with
their present parochial way of singing.” Indeed, he inclines to
think they must also be content with their “grandsire Sternhold,”
for Bishop Beveridge had declared that the common people could
understand the Psalms of Sternhold better than those of Tate and
Brady. Wesley says there may be truth in this, for the common
people “have a strange genius at understanding nonsense.” He
adds that the people at Epworth “did once sing well, and it cost a
pretty deal to teach them.” The singing, however, was now not
so good as formerly, and he hopes his curate will tune them up
again by meeting them at church in the long winter evenings, and
by getting the scholars to sing as they used to do when he first
came thither.</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning his “studies,” Mr Wesley advises his curate to add
to his knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages a knowledge
of the Hebrew, for that is necessary in order to be a complete
divine. He contends that, while logic, history, law, pharmacy,
philosophy, chronology, geography, mathematics, poetry, music,
and other parts of learning, are to be read and studied, they must
all be used as auxiliaries to divinity. The Bible, however, must be
the main subject of a clergyman’s studies, and this ought always
to be read with devotion. The Apocryphal Books ought not to be
neglected, being of great and venerable antiquity, and some of
them referred to by St Paul, and perhaps also by our Saviour.
Mr Wesley then proceeds to enumerate a host of writers whose
works are worthy of being read or otherwise. Tertullian had fire
enough, and Justin and Clemens Alexandrinus sense and learning;
but Origen is worth them and all others put together. Irenæus
is learned, acute, orthodox, zealous, and devout; and St Cyprian
is safer than his master Tertullian; but Lactantius, notwithstanding
the purity of his language and the beauty of his periods, is so
novel a Christian, or so rank an heretic, that he scarce had patience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>to read him. Socrates and Plato are almost transcripts of Pythagoras.
Tully is worth all the Romans. Seneca is well worth
reading. And thus Samuel Wesley runs through all the principal
writers, Christian and heathen, from the birth of Christ to the
time of the Reformation. He had not read much of Luther;
Melancthon was ingenious and polite; Calvin worthy of being read
with caution. Bucer was pious, learned, and moderate; Bellarmine
had all the strength of the Romanists; Fisher was a great
man; Gardiner was far from being contemptible; Erasmus useful
and pleasant; Jewel neat and strong; Cranmer pious and erudite;
but Ridley, among all the Reformers, for clearness, closeness,
strength, and learning, stands pre-eminent. Chillingworth was
one of the best disputants in the world; Grotius was the prince
of commentators, and worth all the rest, though he seems not
always consistent with himself; Hammond was learned, judicious,
and orthodox, if you throw aside his Jerusalem, and Gnostics, and
Simon Magus; Sanderson was a master casuist; Mede has many
bright and happy thoughts; the critics were worth a king’s ransom,
and most of them might be found in Pool’s Synopsis.</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of his own contemporaries, Wesley proceeds to say:—Tillotson
brought the art of preaching near perfection, but Stillingfleet
was a more universal scholar; and yet Archbishop Sharpe
was a more popular pulpit orator than either. Bishop Pearson was
a man of almost inimitable sense, piety, and learning, and his work
on the creed ought to be in every clergyman’s study, though unable
to purchase anything else than the Bible and the Book of Common
Prayer. Bishop Bull was a strong and nervous writer; and the
sermons of Bishop Beveridge were in themselves a library. Bishop
Spratt was one of the first masters of the English language.
Bishop Burnet, notwithstanding his Scotticisms, had a prodigious
genius, and a body that would bear almost anything, for he
himself had told Wesley that, at one period of his life, his circumstances
were such that, to retrieve them, he lived upon three-halfpence
a day. Bishop Ken made almost all who heard him
preach begin to weep; Bishop Hopkins was judicious and useful;
Isaac Barrow strong, masculine, and noble; Dodwell had piety
and learning, but was overfond of nostrums; Ray, Derham, and
Boyle were as useful as entertaining; Calamy’s, Smalridge’s, and
Atterbury’s sermons were standards; Whitby was learned and
laborious, though he had brought his squirt to quench hell-fire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>and to diminish the honour of his Lord and Master; and Le
Clerc had more wit than learning, and less faith than either.
Judge Hale was strong, pious, and nervous; Nelson genteel, zealous,
and instructive; Leslie, against the Jews and Deists, was
demonstrative; Kettlewell, wonderfully pious and devout; and
Hickes’s Letters against the Papists unanswerable. Among his old
friends, the Dissenters, Mr Wesley mentions Richard Baxter, whom
he had heard preach, and whose practical writings, as well as sermons,
had a strange fire and pathos; Dr Annesley, a man of great
piety and of very good learning; Charnock, diffuse and lax, but
very good; Howe, close, strong, and metaphysical; Alsop, merry
and witty; Bates, polite and polished; Williams, orthodox and
possessed of good sense, especially that of getting money; Calamy,
whose style is not amiss; Bradbury, who is fire and feather; Burgess,
who had more sense than he made use of; Shower, polite;
Cruse, unhappy; Owen, a gentleman and a scholar; Matthew
Henry, commended for his laborious work on the Old Testament;
and Clarkson, Tillotson’s tutor, who knew more about the Fathers
than all the Dissenters put together.</p>

<p class='c001'>After going through this long list of authors, with whose writings
he was himself more or less acquainted, Mr Wesley takes up
the fifth section of his pamphlet—viz., Preaching; and says here
“he ought to blush for pretending to give rules for that wherein
he was never master, but it is far easier to direct than it is to
practise.” First, he advises his curate to prepare a course of sermons
on all the principles of religion, so as to comprise, as near
as may be, the whole body of divinity. He then proceeds to say—“I
sincerely hate what some call a fine sermon, with just
nothing in it. I cannot for my life help thinking that it is very
like our fashionable poetry—a mere polite nothing.” He recommends
that the divisions of a sermon be not too long, or too
many; that its illustrations be proper and lively, its proofs close
and pointed, its motives strong and cogent, and its inferences and
application natural, and yet laboured with all the force of sacred
eloquence. He also recommends a prudent, occasional mixture of
controversial sermons against papists, sectaries, and heretics; and
that the curate, instead of reading his sermons, should repeat
them from memory. He advises him to preach suitable sermons
in every year, on November 5th, January 30th, May 29th, and
August 1st.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>In reference to “Catechising,” he says, the curate will have
assistance from the pious and careful schoolmaster, in whose house
he will live. He thinks that catechising had much to do with the
speedy and wide propagation of the Reformed religion, and has
little hope that the Church of England will maintain its position
if this be neglected. He expresses the opinion that catechising
should not be confined to the season of Lent only, but should be
practised at evening service on all Sundays and holidays; and
that when the children have been made perfect in the ordinary
church catechism, they should be taught some larger one. He
himself had adopted this plan, using, as his second catechism,
that published by Bishop Beveridge.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the administration of the Sacraments, he hopes that the
curate will succeed in doing what he had never been able to do
himself—viz., getting the godfathers and godmothers at baptisms
to repeat the responses. The greatest struggle of his ministerial
life at Epworth, had been to prevail with the people to bring
their children to church for public baptism, and their wives to
be churched. In many instances, parents deferred the baptism of
their children so long that they brought such monsters of men-children
to the font as were almost enough to break his arms
while holding them, and whose manful voices were enough to disturb
and alarm the whole congregation. This was an evil which
ought to be set right. The Lord’s Supper was administered in
Epworth Church once a month, and a collection made, at which
Mr Wesley, for the sake of example, always gave something himself.
This sacrament money, when entered in the church book,
was kept in the box appointed for it, with three canonical locks
and keys, one of the keys being held by the rector; three-fourths
of the money were paid for the children at the charity school, and
the remainder put into the bank for such poor sick people as had
no constant relief from the parish, and who came to the sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enforcement of Discipline was not the least difficult task.
He requests that the curate will direct the churchwardens to enforce
the ninetieth canon, and diligently see that all the parishioners
resort to church, and not stay idling in the churchyard or
porch; and that he keep the churchwardens themselves from the
alehouse during divine service. He states that he had always
brought to public penance anti-nuptial and no-nuptial fornicators.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>He advises that there be no disputations with Dissenters, for when
he first came to Epworth he had practised this, but his opponents
always outfaced and outlunged him, and, at the end, they were
just where they were at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley then concludes by saying, that he had spent some
weeks in writing “this tedious and most unfashionable letter;”
and adds, “Go on in the way of duty. I hope there will be no
dispute between us, but who shall run fastest and fairest; and if
I am distanced, I will limp after you as fast as I can with such a
weight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such are the salient points and facts in Mr Wesley’s letter to a
young clergyman. John Wesley acted upon some of its advices
in Georgia with respect to visiting and catechising, and strongly
urged the same upon his first itinerants; and George Whitefield
acknowledged, in 1737, that the letter had been of service to himself.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus did Mr Wesley labour to benefit the church and to bless
mankind. Meanwhile, as usual, he was struggling with embarrassments,
and with no ordinary trials. Mrs Wesley, in 1721,
states that she was rarely in health, and Mr Wesley began to
suffer from the infirmities of age. Emily had been compelled to
become a teacher in a boarding-school; Sukey had been married
to a man little better than a fiend; other children were at home,
wanting neither industry nor capacity for business; but the
parents could do nothing for them. The eldest daughter was
absent, the second ruined, and all the rest in great distress. The
parsonage was not half furnished, nor the family half clothed,
but amid all, the venerable man was patient, and his wife loving.
“Did I not know,” she writes, “that Almighty wisdom hath
views and ends in fixing the bounds of our habitation, which are
out of our ken, I should think it a thousand pities that a man
of his brightness, and rare endowments of learning and useful
knowledge, in relation to the Church of God, should be confined
to an obscure corner of the country, where his talents are buried,
and he determined to a way of life for which he is not so well
qualified as I could wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the midst of all this, he obtained, in 1726, the small rectory
of Wroot, about five miles from Epworth, and here he sometimes
resided, but this added but little to his domestic comforts, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>profits barely covered the expenses of serving it.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Even as late as
1821, the number of houses in the parish were not more than
fifty-four, and contained a population of only two hundred and
eighty-five.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a> The church, in the days of Wesley, was a small
brick building, having, however, some ancient sepulchral monuments.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a>
The parsonage-house was covered with a roof of thatch,
the country round about was little better than a swamp, and the
inhabitants are thus described by the gifted pen of Mehetabel
Wesley in lines addressed to her sister Emilia:—</p>

<p class='c006'>It has often been said that, generally speaking, there is nothing
which develops a man’s character so much as his own private
letters to his friends. Hitherto we have made sparing use of Mr
Wesley’s correspondence, and hence, that the reader may have an
opportunity, by means of such a test, to form his own opinion respecting
this venerable man, we devote this chapter entirely to his
“letters.” All the letters inserted here were written within the last
eleven years of his eventful life—many of them have been previously
published; but, with respect to others, this is the first time
that they have been submitted to the public eye. A few notes
may be useful; but, with this exception, the chapter will consist
entirely of letters. The chapter is long, but the writer flatters
himself that the reader will thank him for it.</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>Jan. 26, 1724–5</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—I am so well pleased with your decent behaviour,
or, at least, with your letters, that I hope I shall have no occasion
to remember some things that are past. Since you have now, for
some time, bit upon the bridle, I will take care hereafter to put
little honey upon it as oft as I am able; but then it shall be of my
own mere motion, as the last £5 was; for I will bear no rival in
my kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not forget you, neither Dr M.;<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> but have moved that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>way as much as possible; though, I must confess, hitherto with no
great prospect of success.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to what you mention of entering into holy orders,<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a> it is indeed
a great work. I am pleased to find you think it so—as well
that you don’t admire a callow clergyman any more than I do. As
to the motives you take notice of, it is no harm to desire getting
into that office, even with Eli’s sons, ‘to get a piece of bread;’ for
‘the labourer is worthy of his hire;’ though a desire and intention
to lead a stricter life, and a belief one should do so, is a better
reason. But this should by all means be begun before, or else, ten
to one, it will deceive us afterwards. If a man be unwilling and
undesirous to enter into orders, it is easy to guess whether he can
say, with common honesty, that he believes he is moved by the
Holy Spirit to do it. But the principal spring and motive, to
which all the former should be secondary, must certainly be the
glory of God, the service of His Church, with the edification of our
neighbour; and woe to him who, with any meaner leading view,
attempts so sacred a work; for which he should take all the care
he possibly can, with the advice of wiser and elder men, especially
imploring, with all humility, sincerity, and intention of mind, with
fasting and prayer, the direction and assistance of Almighty God
and His Holy Spirit, to qualify and prepare himself for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The knowledge of the languages is a considerable help in this
matter, which, I thank God, all my three sons have, to a very
laudable degree; though God knows, I had never more than a
smattering of them. But then, this must be prosecuted to the
thorough understanding the original text of the sacred Scriptures
by intent and long conversing with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You ask me which is the best commentary on the Bible? The
several paraphrases and translations of it, in the Polyglott, compared
with the original, and with one another, are, in my opinion,
to an honest, devout, industrious, humble mind, infinitely preferable
to any commentary I ever saw written upon it; though Grotius
is the best, (for the most part,) especially on the Old Testament.
Compare the Hebrew Bible, the Vulgate, and the Samaritan in the
Polyglott, in the morning. In the afternoons, which you will; but
be sure to walk an hour, if fair, in the fields. Get Thirleby’s
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Chrysostom de Sacerdotio.”</span> Master it; digest it. Some advices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>I drew up for Mr Hoole, my curate, may not be unuseful to
you. Pray let no one but yourself see them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By all this you see I am not for your going over-hastily into
orders. When I am for your taking them, you shall know; and
it is not impossible but I may then be with you, if God so long
spare my life and health.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I like your verses on the 85th Psalm. I would not have you
bury your talent. All are well. Work and write while you can.
You see Time has shaken me by the hand, and Death is but a little
behind him. My eyes and heart are now almost all I have left;
and I bless God for them.—Your affectionate father,</p>

<p class='c001'>A month after the above was written, Susannah Wesley addressed
her son on the same subject. The following is an extract:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>February 23, 1725.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Jacky</span>,—I was much pleased with your letter to your
father about taking orders, and like the proposal well; but it is an
unhappiness almost peculiar to our family, that your father and I
seldom think alike. I approve the disposition of your mind, and
think the sooner you are a deacon the better; because it may be
an inducement to greater application in the study of practical divinity,
which I humbly conceive is the best study for candidates for
orders. Mr Wesley differs from me, and would engage you, I believe,
in critical learning, which, though accidentally of use, is in
nowise preferable to the other. I earnestly pray God to avert that
greater evil from you of engaging in trifling studies, to the neglect
of such as are absolutely necessary. I dare advise nothing. God
Almighty direct and bless you! Adieu!”<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs Wesley seems to have influenced her husband, and to have
induced him to change his mind. Hence the following unpublished
letter, written within three weeks after the foregoing:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>March 13, 1724–5</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—I have both yours; and have changed my mind
since my last. I now incline to your going this summer into
orders, and would have you turn your thoughts and studies that
way. But, in the first place, if you love yourself, or me, pray
heartily. I will struggle hard, but I will get money for your
orders, and something more. Mr Downes has spoken to Dr Morley
about you, who says he will inquire of your character.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Trust in the Lord, and do good, and verily thou shalt be fed.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“This with blessing, from your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>A visit to Wroot by Samuel Wesley, jun., led to a short postponement
of John’s ordination. The following letter, hitherto
unpublished, refers to this:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>May 10, 1725</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Your brother Samuel, with his wife and child, are
here. I did what I could that you might have been in orders this
Trinity; but I doubt your brother’s journey hither has, for the
present, disconcerted our plans; though you will have more time
to prepare yourself for ordination, which I pray God you may, as
I am, your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Part of the following letter was printed in the first volume of
the <cite>Arminian Magazine</cite>, p. 30, but, in the original manuscript,
all allusions to John Wesley’s position and prospects are omitted.
The subjoined is an exact and full copy:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>July 14, 1725</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—It is not for want of affection that I am some
letters in your debt; but because I could not yet answer them, so
as to satisfy myself or you; though I hope still to do it in a few
weeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for Thomas â Kempis, all the world are apt to strain
for one or the other. And it is no wonder if contemplative
men, especially when wrapt in a cowl, and the darkness of the
sceptical divinity, and near akin, if I mistake not, to the obscure
ages, when they observed the bulk of the world so mad for sensual
pleasures, should run into the contrary extreme, and attempt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>persuade us to have no senses at all, or that God made them to very
little purpose. But for all that, mortification is still an indispensable
Christian duty. The world is a syren, and we must have a
care of her. And if the young man will ‘rejoice in his youth,’ yet
it would not be amiss for him to take care that his joys be moderate
and innocent; and, in order to this, sadly to remember ‘that
for all these things God will bring him to judgment.’ I have only
this to add of my friend and old companion, that, making a pretty
man grains of allowance, he may be read to great advantage, and
that, notwithstanding all his superstition and enthusiasm, it is
almost impossible to peruse him seriously, without admiring, and,
I think, in some measure imitating his heroic strains of humility,
and piety, and devotion. But I reckon, you have before this received
your mother’s, who has leisure to write, and can do so
without pain, which I cannot.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will write to the Bishop of Lincoln again. You shall not
want a black coat as soon as I have any <em>white</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You may transcribe any part of my letter to Mr Hoole, but
not the whole, for your own private use; neither lend it; but any
friend may read it in your chamber. Master St Chrysostom, and
the Articles, and the Form of Ordination. Bear up stoutly against
the world, &amp;c. Keep a good, an honest, and a pious heart. Pray
hard, and watch hard; and I am persuaded your quarantine is
almost at an end, and all shall be well: however, nothing shall be
wanting to make it so, that is in the power of, your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The following unpublished letter to his son John, after referring
to a painful family occurrence, goes on to say:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>August 2, 1725</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I was at Gainsborough last week, to wait on Sir J. Thorold,
and shall again, by God’s leave, be there to-morrow, and endeavour
to make way for you from that quarter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to the gentlemen candidates you write of, does anybody
think the devil is dead, or so much as asleep, or that he has no
agents left? Surely virtue can bear being laughed at. The Captain
and Master endured something more for us, before He entered
into glory; and unless we track His steps, in vain do we hope to
share that glory with Him. Nor shall any who sincerely endeavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>to serve Him, either in turning others to righteousness, or keeping
them steadfast in it, lose their reward. Nor can you have better
directions, (except Timothy and Titus,) than Chrysostom de Sacerdotio,
and the Form of Ordination. And God forbid that I should
ever cease to pray for you!—Your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The following to his son John was accompanied with a certificate
of birth and baptism:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>August 21, 1725</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Thanks be to God! we are all well. I send the
certificate on the other side, and will be soon with Mr Downes at
Dr Morley’s. You need not show the other side, unless it is asked
for. Say you are in the 23d current.—Your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The next letter also has never yet been published. Both Samuel
Wesley and his son John, at this time, were in great distress for
want of money.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Bawtry</span>, <i>Sept. 1, 1725</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—I came hither to-day, because I cannot be at rest,
till I make you easier. I could not possibly manufacture any money
for you here, sooner than next Saturday. On Monday I design to
wait on Dr Morley, and will try to prevail with your brother to
return you £8, with interest. I will assist you in the charges for
ordination, though I am myself just now struggling for life. This
£8 you may depend on the next week, or the week after.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I like your way of thinking and arguing; and yet must say, I
am a little afraid on it. He that believes and yet argues against
reason, is half a Papist, or enthusiast. He that would make Revelation
bend to his own shallow reason is either half a Deist or a
heretic. O my dear! steer clear between this Scylla and Charybdis.

<p class='c001'>John Wesley was ordained deacon on Sunday, the 19th of September
1725, by Dr Potter, then Bishop of Oxford.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a> The day
after his ordination he wrote to his father, and the following is
his father’s reply:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>Oct. 19, 1725</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—I had yours of the 20th ult., with the welcome
news that you were in deacon’s orders. I pray God you may so
improve in them, as to be in due time fit for a higher station.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you gave any occasion for what is said of you at L——,
you must bear it patiently, if not joyfully. But be sure never to
return the like treatment. I have done what I could, do you the
same; and rest the whole on Providence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The hard words in yours are of the same nature with an anathema,
whose point is levelled against obstinate heretics. But is
not even schism a work of the flesh, and therefore damnable?
And yet is there not a distinction between what is wilful, and
what may be in some measure involuntary? God knows, and
doubtless will make a difference. We do not so well know it, and
therefore must leave it to Him, and keep to the rules He has given
us.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to the main of the cause, the best way to deal with your
adversaries is, to turn the war and their own vaunted arms against
them. From balancing the schemes, it would appear that there
are many irreconcilable absurdities and traditions in theirs, with
none such, though indeed some difficulties, in ours. To instance
but one of a side. They can never prove a contradiction in our
Three and One, unless we affirmed them to be so in the same respect,
which every child knows we do not. We can prove there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>is a contradiction in a creature’s being a Creator, which they assert
of our Lord.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you turn your thoughts and studies this way, you may do
God and His Church good service. To His blessing and protection
I commit you; and am, your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>All the foregoing letters refer, less or more, to John Wesley being
ordained a deacon, and, on that account, are not without interest.
Some of them, up to the present, have never appeared in
print; and the remainder, with one exception, have never been
published in full as they are published here. The young deacon
was still embarrassed for want of money, and his father was at
his wit’s end how to serve him. Hence another letter, the last we
shall give for the year 1725:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>Nov. 30, 1725</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Son John</span>,—You see, by the enclosed, that I am not unmindful
of you. All I can do for you, (and God knows more than I
can honestly do,) is to give you credit with Richard Ellison for
£10 next Lady-Day.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Subjoined are four letters written in the year 1726. Those
dated March 21st and April 17th, have not before been published.
The whole of them were addressed to John Wesley.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>January 26, 1726.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—The providence of God has engaged me in a
work, wherein you may be very assistant to me, promote the glory
of God, and, at the same time, notably forward your own studies.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have sometime since designed an edition of the holy Bible
in octavo, in the Hebrew, Chaldee, Septuagint, and Vulgate; and
have made some progress in it. I have not time at present to
give you the whole scheme, of which scarce any soul knows except
your brother Sam.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What I desire of you is, first, that you would immediately fall
to work, and read diligently the Hebrew text in the Polyglott, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>collate it exactly with the Vulgate, writing all, even the least, variations
or differences between them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Second, To these I would have you add the Samaritan text,
which is the very same with the Hebrew, except in some very few
places, differing only in the Samaritan character, which I think
is the true old Hebrew.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You may learn the Samaritan alphabet in a day, either from
the Prolegomena in Walton’s Polyglott, or from his grammar. In
a twelvemonth’s time, sticking close to it in the forenoons, you
will get twice through the Pentateuch; for I have done it four
times the last year, and am going over it the fifth, and also collating
the two Greek versions, the Alexandrian and the Vatican,
with what I can get of Symmachus and Theodotian, &amp;c. You
shall not lose your reward, either in this or the other world. Nor
are your brothers like to be idle; but I would have nothing said
of it to anybody, though your brother Sam shall write to you
shortly about it.”<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>What the full extent of Mr Wesley’s scheme was, we are not
able to learn; but probably it was the publication, on a wide
basis, of a Polyglott Bible.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley was elected Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, on
the 17th of March 1726. Four days afterwards, his father wrote
the following short letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>March 21, 1726</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr Fellow Elect of Lincoln</span>,—I have done more
than I could for you. On your waiting on Dr Morley with this he
will pay you £12. You are inexpressibly obliged to that generous
man. We are all as well as can be expected. Your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It was no trifle for this venerable man to meet the moderate
expenses incurred by his son John at the Oxford University.
Hence the following:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>April 1, 1726</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son John</span>,—I had both yours since the election. In
both you express yourself as becomes you for what I had willingly,
though with much greater difficulty than you imagine, done for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>you; for the last £12 pinched me so hard, that I am forced to
beg time of your brother Sam, till after harvest, to pay him the
£10 that you say he lent you. Nor shall I have so much as that,
(perhaps not £5) to keep my family till after harvest; and I do
not expect that I shall be able to do anything for Charles when
he goes to the University. What will be my own fate, God
knows, before this summer be over. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sed passi graviora.</i></span> Wherever
I am, my Jack is Fellow of Lincoln!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet all this, and perhaps worse than you know, has not made
me forget you; for I wrote to Dr King, desiring leave for you to
come one, two, or three months into the country, where you
should be gladly welcome.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for advice, keep your best friend fast; and, next to him,
Dr Morley; and have a care of your other friends, especially the
younger. All at present from your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Sixteen days after this Mr Wesley wrote to his son again, as
follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>April 17, 1726.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—I hope Sander will be with you by Wednesday
noon, with the horses, books, and bags, and this. I got your
mother to write the enclosed, (for you see I can hardly scrawl,<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a>)
because it was possible it might come to hand on Tuesday; but
my head was so full of cares that I forgot on Saturday last to put
it into the post house. I should be very glad to see you, though
but for a day; but much more for a quarter of a year. I think
you will make what haste you can. I design to be at the Crown
in Bawtry on Saturday se’ennight. God bless and send you a

</div>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley came to his father’s a few days after the date of
the above letter, and spent the summer at Epworth and at Wroot.
Here he usually read prayers, and preached twice every Sabbath;
and, in various ways, assisted the venerable rector. He still pursued
his studies, and had frequent opportunities of conversing
with his parents, and kept a regular diary of what transpired.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>He takes notice of the particular subjects discussed in their various
conversations, and among others mentions the following: how
to increase our faith, our hope, and our love of God; <a id='corr400.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='prudence'>prudence,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_400.3'><ins class='correction' title='prudence'>prudence,</ins></a></span>
simplicity, sincerity, pride, and vanity; wit, humour, fancy, courtesy,
and general usefulness. He returned to Oxford on the 21st

<p class='c001'>We now proceed to lay before the reader seven letters written
during the year 1727; the first, second, fourth, and seventh of
which are now for the first time published.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>June 6, 1727</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Son John</span>,—I hope I may still be able to serve both my
cures this summer; or, if not, die pleasantly in my last <em>dike</em>. If
that should happen, I see no great difficulty in bringing your
pupil down with you, say a quarter of a year, where you may
both live at least as cheap as at Oxford. I shall be myself at
Epworth, as soon as I can get a lodging.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is all to you at present from your humble father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Charles Wesley was now at Oxford, and the following letter
was written to him and his brother John unitedly:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Bawtry</span>, <i>June 21, 1727</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Lads</span>,—This moment I received the satisfaction of
yours of the 14th inst. I had no more reason to doubt your duty
to me, than you have had of mine to you; although I am sure
you cannot think it proper there should be two masters in a
family. Read! reflect! You know I cannot but love you; if
you please, and if you think it worth your while that an old father
should love you.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What should I be, if I did not take your offer to come down
soon? But you could not now get from hence to Wroot; though
I can make shift to get from Wroot to Epworth by boat; and it
cannot be worse this summer. However, if you have any prospect
of doing good to F——n<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> (let none of my lads ever despair,)
I beg you, for God’s sake, to take to him again; for how do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>know, that you may thereby save a soul from death, and cover a
multitude of sins? I heartily give you this advice, and beg of
you, as you love God, or me, that you would follow it, as far as it
is practicable. Once more, remember what a soul is worth, as you
know what price was paid for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope, in a fortnight, to be able to walk to Epworth. When
I am tired, I will send you word. If you should come, it would
be best to buy a horse; for I have now ground enough to spare
for a dozen. I am weary.—From your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The above letter refers to the difficulty of travelling in the
neighbourhood of Epworth. The following, written five days
later, alludes to the same matter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>June 26, 1727</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son John</span>,—I do not think I have yet thanked you
enough for your kind and dutiful letter of the 14th inst, which I
received at Bawtry, last Wednesday, and answered there in a
hurry; yet, on reflection, I see no reason to alter my mind much
as to what I then writ; but, if you had any prospect of doing
good on your pupil, I should have been pleased with your attempting
it some time longer. If that is past, or hopeless, there is an
end of the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When you come hither, after having taken care of Charterhouse
and your own rector, your headquarters will, I believe, be
for the most part at Wroot, as mine, if I can, at Epworth,
though sometimes making an exchange. The truth is, I am
<em>hipp’d</em> by my voyage and journey to and from Epworth last Sunday;
being lamed with having my breeches too full of water,
partly with a downfall from a thunder shower, and partly from
the wash over the boat. Yet I thank God I was able to preach
here in the afternoon, and was as well this morning as ever,
except a little pain and lameness, both of which I hope to wash off
with a hair of the same dog this evening.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish the rain had not reached us on this side Lincoln; but
we have it so continual that we have scarce one bank left, and I
cannot possibly have one quarter of oats in all the levels; but,
thanks be to God, the fields of barley and rye are good. We can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>neither go afoot nor on horseback to Epworth, but only by boat
as far as Scawsit Bridge, and then walk over the common, though
I hope it will soon be better. I would gladly send horses, but
don’t think I have now any that would perform the journey; for—1.
My filly has scarcely recovered from the last, and I question
if she ever will. However, I have turned her up to the waggon,
and very seldom ride her. 2. Mettle is almost blind. 3. Your
favourite two-eyed nag they have taken to swing in the back, and
he is never like to be good for riding any more. 4. And Bounce
and your mother’s nag, you know. Therefore, if you can get a
pretty strong horse, not over fine, nor old, nor fat, I think it
would improve, especially in summer, and be worth your while.
I would send as far as Nottingham to meet you, but would have
your studies as little intermitted as possible, and hope I shall do
a month or two longer, as I am sure I ought to do all I can both
for God’s family and my own; and when I find it sinks me, or
perhaps a little before, I will certainly send you word, with about
a fortnight’s notice; and in the meantime send you my blessing,
as being your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>“<i>P.S.</i>—Dear Charles, were I you, it should go hard but I’d get
one of the Blenheim prizes. Thomas calls. Good night to you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Nine days after, Mr Wesley wrote again to his two sons at
Oxford. The Rev. Elijah Hoole, D.D., has kindly favoured me with
a copy of the letter, which has never been published until now:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>July 5, 1727</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Children</span>,—The reason why I was willing to delay my
son John’s coming was his pupil; but that is over. Another
reason was that I knew he could not get between Wroot and
Epworth without hazarding his health or life; whereas my hide
is tough, and I think no carrion can kill me. I walked sixteen
miles yesterday, and this morning, I thank God, I was not a
penny worse. The occasion of this booted walk was to hire a
room for myself at Epworth, which I think I have now achieved.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>(After this follows his proposal that Charles should come to
Lincolnshire by the carrier. He then proceeds:—)</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“You will find your mother much altered. I believe what will
kill a cat has almost killed her. I have observed of late little
convulsions in her very frequently, which I don’t like.</p>

<p class='c001'>“God bless and guide, and send you both a speedy and happy
meeting with, your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The next two letters were written on the same day, within a
fortnight after the former one. The first refers to Mrs Wesley’s
illness:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>July 18, 1727</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son John</span>,—We received last post your compliments
of condolence and congratulation to your mother on the supposition
of her near approaching demise; to which your sister Patty
will by no means subscribe, for she says she is not so good a
philosopher as you are, and that she cannot spare her mother yet,
if it please God, without great inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And indeed, though she has now and then some very sick
fits, yet I hope the sight of you will revive her. However,
when you come you will see a new face of things, my family
being now pretty well colonised, and all perfect harmony; much
happier, in no small straits, than perhaps we ever were before in
our greatest affluence; and you will find a servant that will make
us rich, if God gives us anything to work upon. I know not but
that it may be this prospect, together with my easiness in my
family which keeps my spirits from sinking, though they tell me I
have lost some of my tallow between Wroot and Epworth; but that
I don’t value, as long as I have strength left to perform my office.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If Charles can get to London, I believe Hardsley, at the Red
Lion, Aldersgate Street, might procure him a horse as reasonably
as any to ride along with you to Lincoln. He will also direct him
where to leave it there for the carrier to return. This will be
the cheapest and the safest way; and I will warrant you will find
means to bring Charles up again. Your own best way, as in my
last, will be to buy a horse for yourself for the reasons I then
told you. I am weary, but your loving father,</p>

</div>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Wroot</span>, <i>July 18, 1727</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Charles</span>,—I told you the Chaldee would be easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>(Scaliger says the Ethiopic is but a dialect of it,) so will the
Syriac, and even the Arabic, as soon as you can crack it, and I
believe pleasanter as well as richer than all the rest. And I
doubt not but he that is master of the Hebrew may soon conquer
all the others, which will both receive it and give light to each
other, especially, (as I have heard,) the Arabic, whereof I question
whether it be ever exhaustible, and which is yet spoken and writ
from the hills of Grenada to the uttermost easterly bounds of the
world. I have a sample of it for you here, if you are not got so
far, in a specimen of the Arabic Testament, and have picked out
a pretty many words in Job, which the commentators say are of
one of those three languages, wherein your assistance will do me
a great pleasure. If you can, get the Oxford edition of Tacitus’s
Annals, transcribing the passage in the sixth book concerning the
Phœnix, and the annotations upon it, and be so kind as to bring
them with you.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have writ, on the other side, to your brother my thoughts of
the best way of your coming; and the sooner you come the better;
but you will send word by post the day we must send for you to
Lincoln. I heartily wish I could as well send you both a viaticum
as I do my best blessings.—From your affectionate father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Eight days after, Mr Wesley wrote to his son, John, stating his
intention to meet him at Lincoln. The letter is now for the first
time published, the copy being kindly furnished by Dr Hoole:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>July 26, 1727.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Son John</span>,—I shall be at Lincoln, (<em>D.V.</em>,) on the —— inst.,
and shall stay till Friday morning. If you can get thither by
Wednesday or Thursday night, I shall be glad of your company
home. And not long after, I hope to send Charles a <em>totable</em>
reason for following. Whenever you come, you will be fully welcome
to your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley came to Epworth and Wroot accordingly. Here
he continued to act as his father’s curate till July 1728, when he
returned to Oxford, with a view to obtain priest’s orders. Two
months afterwards, on September 22, he was ordained priest by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Dr Potter, who had ordained him deacon in 1725. He immediately
returned to the assistance of his father in Lincolnshire,
where, excepting a short interval, he continued until November
22, 1729, when, at the request of his faithful friend, Dr Morley,
the rector of his college, he returned to Oxford to fulfil the office
of moderator. Meanwhile, Charles Wesley was pursuing his
studies at Christ Church College, and, though only twenty-two
years old, had begun to take pupils. The following letters were
written during this period. For the first we are indebted to the
kindness of Dr Hoole. Hitherto it has been unpublished:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Sept. 5, 1728</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Your mother had yours yesterday, as I suppose
before this you have had hers and mine, with the certificate.
Yours brought the good news of Charles’s recovery, which will
supersede his country journey, and help him to regain the time
he has lost in his studies.</p>

<p class='c001'>“M—— miraculously gets money even in Wroot, and has given
the first fruits of her earning to her mother, lending her money,
and presenting her with a new cloak of her own buying and
making, for which God will bless her. When we get to Epworth,
she will grow monstrously rich, for she will have more work than
she can do, and the people are monstrously civil.</p>

<p class='c001'>“God has given me two fair escapes for life within these few
weeks. The first when my old nag fell with me, trailed me by my
foot in the stirrups about six yards, (when I was alone, all but God
and my good angel,) trod on my other foot, yet never hurt me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The other escape was much greater. On Monday week, at
Burringham Ferry, we were driven down with a fierce stream and
wind, and fell foul with our broadside against a keel. The second
shock threw two of our horses overboard, and filled the boat with
water. I was just preparing to swim for life, when John Whitelamb’s
long legs and arms swarmed up into the keel, and lugged
me in after him. My mare was swimming a quarter of an hour,
but at last we all got safe to land. Help to praise Him who saves
both man and beast.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I write with pain, therefore nothing else but love and blessing
from, your affectionate father, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Dick’s just Dick still; but I hope Sukey is not Sukey.”</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Jan. 29, 1730</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Charles</span>,—I had your last with your brother’s, and
you may easily guess whether I were not pleased with it, both on
your account and my own. You have a double advantage by
your pupils, which will soon bring you more if you will improve it,
as I firmly hope you will, in taking the utmost care to form their
minds to piety as well as learning. As for yourself, between
logic, grammar, and mathematics, be idle<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a> if you can; and I give
my blessing to the bishop for having tied you a little faster,
by obliging you to rub up your Arabic. A fixed and constant
method will make all both easy and delightful to you. But for
all that you must find time every day for walking, which you
know you may do with advantage to your pupils; and a little
more robust exercise, now and then, will do you no harm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are now launched fairly, Charles; hold up your head,
and swim like a man; and when you cuff the wave beneath you,
say to it, much as another hero did—</p>

    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Carolum vehis, et Caroli fortunam.’</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But always keep your eye above the pole-star. And so God send
you a good voyage through the troublesome sea of life! which is
the hearty prayer of, your loving father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Immediately after John Wesley’s return to Oxford, in Nov.
1729, he and his brother Charles and two more students began to
meet together, three or four evenings every week, for the purpose
of reading the classics. One of the students was Mr Morgan, who,
during the summer following, called at Oxford Gaol, to see a man
condemned for the murder of his wife. He urged the two Wesleys
to join him in his visits to the prison and to the poor, and, at
last, on the 24th of August 1730, they yielded; but, fearful that
they might be doing wrong, before they fully committed themselves
to this work of visiting, they wrote asking the advice of
their venerable father. Part of his answer, dated September 21,
1730, was as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“And now, as to your own designs and employments, what can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>I say less of them than <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>valde probo</i></span>: and that I have the highest
reason to bless God that He has given me two sons together at
Oxford, to whom He has given grace and courage to turn the war
against the world and the devil, which is the best way to conquer
them. They have but one more enemy to combat with, the flesh;
which, if they take care to subdue, by fasting and prayer, there
will be no more for them to do but to proceed steadily in the same
course, and expect the crown which fadeth not away. You have
reason to bless God, as I do, that you have so fast a friend as Mr
M.,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a> who, I see, in the most difficult service, is ready to break the
ice for you. You do not know of how much good that poor
wretch who killed his wife has been the providential occasion. I
think I must adopt Mr M. to be my son, together with you and
your brother Charles; and when I have such a ternion to prosecute
that war, wherein I am now <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>miles emeritus</i></span>, I shall not be
afraid when they speak with their enemies in the gate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am afraid lest the main objection you make against going
on in the business with the prisoners, may secretly proceed from
flesh and blood. Go on, then, in God’s name, in the path to
which your Saviour has directed you, and that track wherein your
father has gone before you! For when I was an undergraduate
at Oxford, I visited those in the castle there, and reflect on it
with great satisfaction to this day. Walk as prudently as you
can, though not fearfully, and my heart and prayers are with
you.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your first regular step is, to consult with him (if any such
there be) who has a jurisdiction over the prisoners; and the next
is, to obtain the direction and approbation of your bishop. This
is Monday morning, at which time I shall never forget you. If it
be possible, I should be glad to see you all three here in the fine
end of summer. But if I cannot have that satisfaction, I am sure
I can reach you every day, though you were in the Indies. Accordingly,
to Him who is everywhere I now heartily commit you, as
being your most affectionate and joyful father,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley thus gave an impulse to the first Methodist
movement. In pursuance of his directions, his son John obtained
the consent of the Bishop of Oxford to visit the prisoners, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>to preach to them once a month. These proceedings were soon
known in the university, and John Wesley and his friends became
a common topic of collegiate mirth, and were jeeringly designated
“The Holy Club.” John again consulted his father, and was answered
as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>December 1, 1730.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“This day I received yours; and this evening, in the course of
our reading, I thought I found an answer that would be more proper
than any I myself could dictate. ‘Great is my glorying of
you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful.’ (2 Cor. vii.
4.) What would you be? Would you be angels? I question
whether a mortal can arrive to a greater degree of perfection than
steadily to do good, and for that very reason patiently and meekly
to suffer evil. For my part, on the present view of your actions
and designs, my daily prayers are that God would keep you
humble; and then, I am sure that if you continue ‘to suffer for
righteousness’ sake,’ though it be but in a lower degree, ‘the Spirit
of glory and of God’ shall, in some good measure, ‘rest upon you.’
Be never weary of well-doing; never look back; for you know the
prize and the crown are before you; though I can scarce think so
meanly of you, as that you would be discouraged with ‘the crackling
of thorns under a pot.’ Be not high-minded, but fear. Preserve
an equal temper of mind, under whatever treatment you meet
with from a not very just or well-natured world. Bear no more
sail than is necessary, but steer steady. The less you value yourselves
for these unfashionable duties, the more all good and wise
men will value you, if they see your actions are of a piece; or,
which is infinitely more, He by whom actions and intentions are
weighed will both accept, esteem, and reward you.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“I hear my son John has the honour of being styled the ‘Father
of the Holy Club:’ if it be so, I must be the grandfather of it;
and I need not say that I had rather any of my sons should be so
dignified and distinguished than to have the title of <em>His Holiness</em>.”<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Who can tell the influence which such a letter had in urging
John Wesley and his little band of Methodists to proceed in their
new career?</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley, though paralysed in his right hand, was busily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>engaged in completing his “Dissertation on the Book of Job.” He
wished to dedicate his work to Queen Caroline, and wrote to both
his sons, Samuel and John, relative to the proper mode of proceeding.
John, however, was now stigmatized as the “Father of the
Holy Club,” and Samuel had given offence in high quarters by his
poetical satires on the cabinet and their friends, and hence, for the
present, it was found impracticable to obtain the queen’s permission.
The following letter refers to this. It was addressed to
Samuel:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Dec. 17, 1730</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Yours of the 11th inst. has made me pretty quiet
in reference to my dedication, as indeed my heart was never violently
set upon it, or I hope on anything else in this world. I find
it stuck where I always boded it would, as in the words of your
brother in yours, when you waited on him with my letter and
addressed him on the occasion. ‘The short answer I received
was this, it was utterly impossible to obtain leave on my account;
you had the misfortune to be my father; and I had a long bill
against M——n.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“I guess at the particulars, that you have let your wit too loose
against some favourites; which is often more highly resented, and
harder to be pardoned, than if you had done it against greater persons.
It seems, then, that original sin goes sometimes upwards as
well as downwards; and we must suffer for our offspring. Though,
notwithstanding this disappointment, I shall never think it ‘a misfortune
to have been your father.’ I am sensible it would avail
little for me to plead, in proof of my loyalty, the having written
and printed the first thing that appeared in defence of the government
after the accession of King William and Queen Mary to the
crown, (which was an answer to a speech without doors;) and that I
wrote a great many little pieces more, both in prose and verse, with
the same view; and that I ever had the most tender affection and
the deepest veneration for my sovereign and the royal family; on
which account (it is no secret to you, though it is to most others,)
I have undergone the most sensible pains and inconveniences of
my whole life, and that for a great many years together; and yet
have still, I thank God, retained my integrity firm and immovable,
till I have conquered at the last.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I must confess, I had the pardonable vanity (when I had dedicated
two books before to two of our English queens, Queen Mary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>and Queen Anne) to desire to inscribe a third, which has cost me
ten times as much labour as all the rest, to her gracious Majesty

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Yes, this is a thunderbolt indeed to your whole

</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was a strict disciplinarian, not only in his family,
but in his parish. According to the canonical law of the Church
of England, churchwardens took an oath to bring to justice all
who “offended their brethren by adultery, whoredom, incest,
drunkenness, swearing, ribaldry, usury, or any other uncleanness
or wickedness of life,” (Canon 109.) And when churchwardens
violated their oaths by neglecting their duty, it then became imperative
that the clergyman of the parish should present to his
ordinary, the appointed judge of ecclesiastical causes, all the
crimes and persons which he thought needed reformation. (Canon
113.) If the accused person was found guilty of adultery, or incontinency,
the punishment usually inflicted was to do a public
penance in the parish church, or in the market-place, when the
offender, or offenders, stood in a white sheet, bare-legged and bare-headed,
and made an open confession of their crime in a prescribed
form of words. The judge, however, had authority, <em>after</em> the penance
had been enjoined, to permit a commutation of it, by the
criminal paying a sum of money for pious uses in satisfaction
thereof. These remarks will help the reader to a better understanding
of the following letters:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Dec. 30, 1730</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Mr Terry</span>,—On account of our old friendship, I beg your
advice as to the greatest parochial difficulty I have met with since
my residence here.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have two couples of sinners at present upon my hands—the
first very lean; the latter very fat; and I hope your courts will
manage them both very well when they are blended together.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The lean ones are Benjamin Becket, a widower, and Elizabeth
Locker, a widow. Though they had not much less than half-a-score
of children between them before, yet he has ventured to increase
the number by getting a chopping bastard on her. She
had weekly relief from the town; and he was prevented doing the
same by being made sexton last year. They continue both unmarried.
What aggravates his crime is, that, some years since,
he did public penance here for ante-matrimonial fornication with
his first wife. He and the widow are now desirous to do penance
for this crime; and the fellow would undergo even a third penance
by marrying her. I am desirous that their punishment
should be as exemplary as their crime; and that both of them
may perform their penance at three churches of the Isle;—my own
at Epworth, at Haxey, and at Belton. I will see the court charges
defrayed, which I hope will be as moderate as possible, because
most of it is like to come out of my own pocket, and because the
second couple will make amends.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Their names are, Mr Aaron Man, one of the most substantial
yeomen in my parish, reckoned worth about £100 a-year; a married
man, with five grown-up children. He has long haunted a
widow here of a character scarce better than his own. Her name
is Sarah Brumby, with whom he has been seen both day and
night, till at last she proved with child, and told several persons,
who are ready to witness it, that he was the father of it. Notwithstanding
this, he is so impudent and cunning that nobody
doubts but he will do all he can to baffle justice, and even prevail
upon Brumby to retract her confession, and lay it upon some
other. He threatens any one who says he is the father, to put
him into the spiritual court, or bring an action against him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your advice, what steps to take in order to bring these criminals
to public justice, would be very obliging and serviceable to
me, and to the best of my parish. Our opinion is, that, being
guarded with his <em>impenetrable brass</em>, he will obstinately deny the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>fact; and, when he is presented, will refuse public penance. Perhaps
he might be willing to commute, though we are inclined to
believe that he would stand an excommunication, which we know
he does not value, though a capias carried to an outlawry, we believe,
would make him bend.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would not willingly be baffled in this matter, because I look
upon the whole exercise of discipline, in my parish, in a great
measure to depend upon this event.—I am, my most worthy friend,
your entire friend and servant, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The next letter, written six weeks afterwards, relates the steps
which Mr Wesley took in this curious business. It was addressed
“To the Worshipful Mr Chancellor Newell, at Lincoln:”—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Feb. 15, 1731</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I received yours, together with the order of penance for
Benjamin Becket and Elizabeth (then) Locker; and have got them
both to perform it at Epworth and Haxey, on the days appointed;
but the woman, being weakly, was so disordered by standing with
her naked feet, that the women, and even a midwife, assured me
that she would hazard her life if she went to perform it the third
time at Belton in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I could therefore do no more than send the man thither at
the day appointed, who performed it the third time, according to
order, as is certified by myself, Mr Hoole, Mr Morrice, and our
churchwardens, on the instrument you sent us; which is ready to
be returned at the visitation, or when you please. If you don’t
think it proper to remit the woman’s doing penance the third
time, which I entreat that you would, I shall, upon your order in
a letter, oblige her to perform it to the full extent. She appeared
the modestest w—— that I have met with on such an occasion,
and is now an honest married wife, for I married them last Friday.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As soon as this case was over, I fell at my second couple, having
prepared the way by my addresses to a justice of the peace;
and by disposing some of the best of my parishioners to join with
me, on account of the charge that this illegitimate child of Sarah
Brumby might bring upon the parish.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley then proceeds to narrate the proceedings which took
place before the magistrate. Sarah Brumby confessed that her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>child was illegitimate, but refused to tell who was its father. A
witness, “one Mary Jackson, who had been guilty of fornication
herself, and had then a bastard of about six feet high, had told
Wesley that she had heard Brumby say that Aaron Man was the
father, but when brought before the magistrate to give evidence,
she denied all that she had said. Two other witnesses, however,
Elizabeth Piers, and Elizabeth Dawson, the midwife, declared that
they had heard Brumby frequently declare that the father of the
child was Aaron Man.” Mr Wesley then concludes his letter
thus:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“This is the evidence we have got. If we may ground a presentment
on these proofs, in the taking which we have exactly followed
the direction you were so kind to prescribe us, I believe I
shall be able to induce my churchwardens to present both Aaron
Man and Sarah Brumby, as soon as you will be so good as to
teach us how we may proceed,—I am, honoured sir, your very
obliged humble servant, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley pursued this strange business during the whole of
the year 1731. It appears that the churchwardens, William
Watkins and Richard Samson, had neglected to present Aaron
Man and Sarah Brumby for prosecution; and that Mr Chancellor
Newell had threatened to proceed against them for such neglect of
duty. Meanwhile, another case had sprung up. Some years before,
Eliza Hurst had been delivered of an illegitimate child, but
refused to name the father. The Epworth churchwarden, for the
time being, presented her, but no prosecution followed. Mr
Wesley often wrote to the officials respecting her, but without
effect. At length the woman came to him, and earnestly desired
she might perform penance for her offence, whenever the court
should order it. Wesley informed the Chancellor of this, and
here the matter stuck. Since then, Hurst had cohabited with
Thomas Thew, and was likely to have another child. She had
wished to marry Thew, but Mr Wesley refused to perform the
ceremony, until she had done penance for her former fault. It
so happened, however, that there was “a strolling villain in the
parish, called John England, and he coupled them together in a
hemp-kiln, on Saturday, January 22, 1732, they having confessed to
him their fornication, and he having absolved them for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>In consequence of all this, Wesley found himself in an unpleasant
position, and wrote to Chancellor Newell a complaining letter,
dated “February 2, 1732,” and which he concluded by subscribing
himself, “Your much aggrieved friend and servant, <span class='sc'>Samuel
Wesley</span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the day following, he wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Feb. 3, 1732</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—I received the high honour and favour of your
lordship’s, dated Bugden, Christmas-eve. I ever thought it my
duty, since I have been the minister of any parish, to present those
persons who were obnoxious in it, if the churchwardens neglected
it, unless where the criminal was so sturdy, and so wealthy, as that
I was morally certain I could not do it, without my own great
inconvenience or ruin, in which cases God does not require it of
me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>He then refers to the case of Aaron and Brumby, and his unfaithful
churchwardens, and asks—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“What must I do with the two churchwardens, if they offer
themselves to receive the sacrament? Ought I not to repel them
from it, being satisfied in my own mind that they are notoriously
perjured, and have thereby given great scandal to the congregation?
One of them, Richard Samson, offered himself at the communion
at Christmas, but I sent my clerk to desire him privately to withdraw,
because I had written to your lordship about his case, and
had not received your directions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Begging your lordship’s blessing, and a line of answer, I remain,
your lordship’s ever devoted and most humble servant,</p>
<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>These are curious letters, and are inserted here, not as a vindication
of public penances, but simply to show Samuel Wesley’s
stern fidelity. They furnish a sketch of ecclesiastical discipline in
the Church of England, at the time that Samuel Wesley’s sons,
John and Charles, were beginning their Methodist career at Oxford
University. John Wesley tried to enforce the same sort of church
discipline in Georgia; and all clergymen are bound, by their engagements,
to do as Wesley did, that is, act according to the canons
of their Church. Canon-law might need revision; no doubt it did;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>but, because Samuel Wesley had bound himself to observe these
ecclesiastical decrees, he was far too conscientious a man to treat
them as though they did not exist. His stern, perhaps unwise,
fidelity, often brought him into trouble; but, in the midst of all,
his “rejoicing was this, the testimony of his conscience, that in
simplicity and godly sincerity, he had his conversation in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>During the year 1731, Samuel Wesley met with a most serious
accident. Mrs Wesley gives a graphic account of it in the following
letter to her son John:—<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>July 12, 1731.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Jacky</span>,—The particulars of your father’s fall are as
follows:—On Friday, June 4th, I, your sister Martha, and our
maid, were going in our waggon to see the ground we hire of Mrs
Knight, at Low Millwood. He sat in a chair at one end of the
waggon, I in another at the other end, Matty between us, and the
maid behind me. Just before we reached the close, going down a
small hill, the horses took into a gallop; and out flew your father and
his chair. The maid seeing the horses run, hung all her weight on
my chair, and kept me from keeping him company. She cried out
to William to stop the horses, and that her master was killed. The
fellow leaped out of the seat, and stayed the horses, then ran to Mr
Wesley, but, ere he got to him, two neighbours, who were providentially
met together, raised his head, upon which he had pitched,
and held him backward, by which means he began to respire; for
it is certain, by the blackness in his face, that he had never drawn
breath from the time of his fall till they helped him up. By this
time, I was got to him, asked him how he did, and persuaded him
to drink a little ale, for we had brought a bottle with us. He
looked prodigiously wild, but began to speak, and told me he ailed
nothing. I informed him of his fall. He said he ‘knew nothing
of any fall. He was as well as ever he was in his life.’ We bound
up his head, which was very much bruised, and helped him into
the waggon again, and set him at the bottom of it, while I supported
his head between my hands, and the man led the horses softly home.
I sent presently for Mr Harper, who took a good quantity of blood
from him; and then he began to feel pain in several parts, particularly
in his side and shoulder. He had a very ill night, but, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Saturday morning, Mr Harper came again to him, dressed his head,
and gave him something which much abated the pain in his side.
We repeated the dose at bed-time, and, on Sunday, he preached
twice, and gave the sacrament, which was too much for him to do;
but nobody could dissuade him from it. On Monday he was ill,
and slept almost all day. On Tuesday the gout came; but, with
two or three nights taking Bateman, it went off again, and he has
since been better than could be expected. We thought at first
the waggon had gone over him; but it only went over his gown
sleeve, and the nails took a little skin off his knuckles, but did
him no further hurt.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was now in his sixty-ninth year, and the effects of
such an accident, of course, were serious and lasting. He had held
the Epworth living for about five-and-thirty years; but being now,
to a great extent, disabled, he proposed to resign it, if his son
Samuel could use sufficient influence to be appointed his successor.
The Wroot Rectory he had held not longer than about seven years,
and, as John Whitelamb had recently become his curate, and had
married his daughter Mary, he applied to the Lord Chancellor to
have that living transferred to him. The following letters refer to
these intended resignations, and to other matters:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>Feb. 28, 1733.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son Samuel</span>,—For several reasons, I have earnestly
desired, especially in and since my last sickness, that you might
succeed me in Epworth, in order to which I am willing and determined
to resign the living, provided you could make an interest to
have it in my room.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My first and best reason for it is, because I am persuaded you
would serve God and his people here better than I have done.
Though, thanks be to God, after near forty years labour among
them, they grow better, I having had above one hundred at my
last sacrament, whereas I have had less than twenty formerly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My second reason relates to yourself. You have been a father
to your brothers and sisters, especially to the former, who have
cost you great sums in their education, both before and since they
went to the University. Neither have you stopped here, but have
showed your pity to your mother and me in a very liberal manner,
wherein your wife joined with you, when you did not overmuch
abound yourselves, and have even done noble charities to my children’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>children. Now, what should I be if I did not endeavour to
make you easy to the utmost of my power, especially when I know
that neither of you have your health in London?</p>

<p class='c001'>“My third reason is from honest interest; I mean, that of our
family. You know our circumstances. As for your aged and infirm
mother, as soon as I drop, she must turn out, unless you
succeed me; which, if you do, and she survives me, I know you
will immediately take her then to your own house, or rather continue
her there, where your wife and you will nourish her, till we
meet again in heaven, and you will be a guide and stay to the rest
of the family.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are a few things more which may seem to be tolerable
reasons to me for desiring you to be my successor. I have been
at very great and uncommon expense on this living. I have rebuilt
from the ground the parsonage barn and dovecote; leaded,
and planked, and roofed, a great part of my chancel; rebuilt the
parsonage house twice when it had been burnt, the first time one
wing, the second time down to the ground, wherein I lost all my
books and MSS., a considerable sum of money, all our linen, wearing
apparel, and household stuff, except a little old iron, my wife and I
being scorched with the flames, and all of us very narrowly escaping
with life. This, by God’s help, I built again, digging up the
old foundations, and laying new ones. It cost me above £400,
little or nothing of the old materials being left; besides the cost
of new furniture from top to bottom, for we had now very little
more than what Adam and Eve had when they first set up housekeeping.
I then planted the two fronts of my house with wall
fruit the second time, as I had done the front of the previous
house, for the former all perished by the fire. I have set mulberries
in my garden, which bear plentifully, as also cherries,
pears, &amp;c., and, in the adjoining croft, walnuts, and am planting
more every day. And this I solemnly declare, not with any
manner of view that any of mine should enjoy any fruit of my
labour, when I have so long outlived all my friends; but my prospect
was for some unknown person, that I might do what became
me, and leave the living better than I found it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet, I might own, I could not help wishing, that all my
care and charge might not be utterly lost to my family, but that
some of them might be the better for it, though I despaired of it,
till, some time since, the best of my parishioners pressed me
earnestly to try if I could do anything in it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>“All I can do is to resign it to you, which I am ready frankly
and gladly to do, scorning to make any conditions, for I know you
better.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I commend this affair, and you and yours, to God, as becomes
your affectionate father, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a></span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley, jun., declined his father’s offer; and, as we shall
soon see, the same proposal was afterwards made to John. Meanwhile,
the venerable rector still kept plodding at his work on the
Book of Job. To the Rev. Mr Piggot, Vicar of Doncaster, he
wrote respecting this, and respecting his late serious accident, as
follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Feb. 22, 1733</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—Many thanks for your civil letter. I cannot
wonder that any should think long of Job’s coming out, though it
is common in books of this nature, especially when the author is
absent from the press, and there are so many cuts and maps in it,
as must be in mine. However, I owe it to my subscribers, and
indeed to myself, to give some farther account of this matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, if Job’s friends have need of patience, at seeing him lie
so long on the dunghill, or, which is much the same, the printing-house,
how much more has Job himself need of it, who is sensible
his reputation suffers more and more by the delay of it; though,
if he himself had died, as he was lately in a very fair way to it,
having been as good as given over by three physicians, there would
have been no manner of doubt to any one who knows the character
of my son at Westminster, that every subscriber would have had
his book.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I cannot be satisfied with this though I have lost the use
of one hand in the service; yet, I thank God, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>non deficit altera</i></span>,
and I begin to put it to school this day to learn to write, in order
to help its lame brother. And when it can write legibly, I design,
if it please God, to go to London myself this summer, to push on
the editing, by helping to correct the press both in text and maps,
and to frame the indexes, more than which I cannot do.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very many have forgot their large promises to assist me in
it, so that I hardly expect to receive £100 clear for all my ten
years’ pains and labours; but if you will be so kind as to communicate
this to any of my subscribers, who may fall in your way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>it may perhaps give some satisfaction to them, while it will be
but a piece of justice to your most obliged friend and brother,</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was naturally a humane man, and was always on
the alert where benevolence was needed. The following letter is
illustrative of this trait in his character:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>March 27, 1733</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Mr Porter</span>,—Dorothy Whitehead, widow, lately died here,
leaving four small children, and all in her house not sufficient
to bury her, as you will see by the oath of her executor added to
the will; for a will she would have to dispose of a few roods of
land, lest her children should fall out about it. The bearer, Simon
Thew, who is her brother, consented to be her executor, that he
might take care of her children. I gave him the oath, as you will
see, as strictly as I could, and am satisfied it is all exactly true.
They were so poor that I forgave them what was due for it, and
so did even my clerk for the burial. If there be any little matter
due for the probate of the will, I entreat and believe you will be
as low as possible; wherein you know your charity will be acceptable
to God, and will much oblige, your ready friend,</p>

<p class='c001'>As intimated in a previous letter, Mr Wesley went to London
towards the end of the year 1733. Whilst there, he addressed
the following letter “to the Lord Chancellor, for John Whitelamb,
now curate of Epworth”:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Westminster</span>, <i>Jan. 14, 1734</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—The small rectory of Wroot, in the diocese and
county of Lincoln, adjoining to the Isle of Axholme, is in the gift
of the Lord Chancellor, and more than seven years since was conferred
on Samuel Wesley, rector of Epworth. It lies in our low
levels, and is often overflowed. During the four or five years that
I have had it, the people have lost the fruits of the earth to that
degree that it has hardly brought me in £50 per annum, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omnibus
annis</i></span>; and some years not enough to pay my curate there his
salary of £30 a-year. This living, by your lordship’s permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>and favour, I would gladly resign to one Mr John Whitelamb,
born in the neighbourhood of Wroot, where his father and grandfather
lived, when I took him from among the scholars of a
charity school, (founded by one Mr Travers, an attorney,) brought
him to my house, and educated him there, where he was my
amanuensis for four years, in transcribing my ‘Dissertations on
the Book of Job,’ now well advanced in the press; and was employed
in drawing my maps and figures for it, as well as we could
by the light of nature. After this, I sent him to Oxford to my
son, John Wesley, Fellow of Lincoln College, under whom he
made such proficiency, that he was, the last summer, admitted by
the Bishop of Oxford into deacon’s orders, and placed my curate
in Epworth, while I came up to town to expedite the printing of
my book.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since I was here, I gave consent to his marrying one of my
seven daughters, and they are married accordingly; and though
I can spare little more with her, yet I would gladly give them a
little glebe land at Wroot, where I am sure they will not want
springs of water. But <em>they</em> love the place, though I can get nobody
else to reside on it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I do not flatter myself, he is indeed a valuable person, of
uncommon brightness, learning, piety, and indefatigable industry,
always loyal to the king, zealous for the Church, and friendly to
our Dissenting brethren; and for the truth of this character I
will be answerable to God and man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If, therefore, your lordship will grant me the favour to let
me resign the living unto him, and please to confer it on him, I
shall always remain, your lordship’s most bounden, most grateful,
and most obedient servant,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for February 1734, p. 108, the
following announcement is made, in the list of ecclesiastical preferments:—“Mr
Whitelamb to the rectory of Wroot, Lincolnshire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley’s two sons, John and Charles, were still at Oxford,
and, with the other members of “the Holy Club,” were receiving
the sacrament once a week, were practising the fasts of the English
Church, visiting prisoners in the gaol, and the destitute in
the city, and were abridging themselves of all the superfluities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>and of many of the conveniences of life, for the purpose of relieving
the distress with which they met. In December 1731, Samuel
Wesley visited his two sons at Oxford, to see for himself the good
they were doing, and to obtain direct information respecting their
temper and spirit. In a letter to his wife, he says he “was well
paid both for his expense and labour by their <em>shining piety</em>.”
During the course of the ensuing summer, in 1732, John Wesley
made two visits to Epworth; and two others in January and in
June 1733. His father’s health had been seriously affected ever
since his sad accident in June 1731; and as Samuel Wesley, jun.,
had declined to become his father’s successor at Epworth, the
same proposal was now made to John,<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a> and a long correspondence
followed, which lasted till the end of 1734.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a> In a long letter to
his father, written at this period, John Wesley assigns his reasons
for declining the proposal. At Oxford he always had at
hand half a dozen friends like-minded with himself; he was free
from idle and trifling visitors, except once a month when he invited
some of the students to breakfast with him; he was free
from cares, and had the opportunity of attending public prayer
twice a day; he could be holier and usefuller at Oxford than
anywhere else; and the care of two thousand souls at Epworth
was a greater weight than he had ability to bear.</p>

<p class='c001'>His father replied to many of these objections in the following
letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>Nov. 20, 1734.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Your only argument is this: ‘The question is
not whether I could do more good to others there or here, but
whether I could do more good to myself; seeing wherever I can
be most holy myself, there I can most promote holiness in others.
But I can improve myself more at Oxford than at any other
place.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“To this I answer—</p>

<p class='c001'>“1. It is not dear self but the glory of God, and the different
degrees of promoting it, which should be our main consideration
in the choice of any course of life.</p>

<p class='c001'>“2. Supposing you could be more holy yourself at Oxford, how
does it follow that you could more promote holiness in others
there than elsewhere? Have you found many instances of it, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>so many years hard pains and labour? Further, I dare say,
you are more modest and just than to say, there are no holier
men than you at Oxford; and yet it is possible they may not
have promoted holiness more than you have done; as I doubt not
but you might have done it much more, had you taken the right
method. For there is a particular turn of mind for these matters—great
prudence as well as great fervour.</p>

<p class='c001'>“3. I cannot allow austerity or fasting, considered by themselves,
to be proper acts of holiness, nor am I for a solitary life.
God made us for a social life; we are not to bury our talents;
we are to let our light shine before men, and that not barely
through the chinks of a bushel, for fear the wind should blow it
out. The design of lighting it was, that it might give light to all
that went into the house of God. And to this academical studies
are only preparatory.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. You are sensible what figures those make who stay in the
university till they are superannuated. I cannot think drowsiness
promotes holiness. How commonly do they drone away life,
either in a college or in a country parsonage, where they can only
give God the snuffs of them, having nothing of life or vigour left
to make them useful in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>“5. We are not to fix our eye on one single point of duty, but
to take in the complicated view of all the circumstances in every
state of life that offers. Thus in the case before us, put all circumstances
together. If you are not indifferent whether the
labours of an aged father, for above forty years in God’s vineyard,
be lost, and the fences of it trodden down and destroyed; if
you consider that Mr M—— must in all probability succeed me if
you do not, and that the prospect of that mighty Nimrod’s coming
hither shocks my soul, and is in a fair way of bringing down my
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave; if you have any care for our
family, which must be dismally shattered as soon as I am dropt;
if you reflect on the dear love and longing which this poor people
have for you, you may perhaps alter your mind, and bend your will
to His, who has promised, if in all our ways we acknowledge Him,
He will direct our paths.”<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>A large portion of the correspondence on this momentous business
was carried on during Samuel Wesley’s sojourn in London,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>at the commencement of the year 1734. On the 30th of March,
John Brown set out from Epworth to London, to accompany the
venerable rector to his home.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> On his arrival, he wrote as follows
to Dr Reynolds, Bishop of Lincoln:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>May 2, 1734</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>,—I thank God I got well home, and found all well
here. My son-in-law, Mr Whitelamb, is gone with his wife to
reside at Wroot, and takes true pains among the people. He
designs to be inducted immediately after visitation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At my return to Epworth, looking a little among my people,
I found there were two strangers come hither, both of which I
have discovered to be Papists, though they come to church, and I
have hopes of making one or both of them good members of the
Church of England.”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley was always brimful of benevolence, and, as soon as
he was at home again, he showed it. Hence the following characteristic
letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>May 14, 1734</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Mr Stephenson</span>,—As soon as I heard from John Brown that
your kinswoman Stephenson had writ to you for her son Timothy,
and that you had desired her to send for him up, I spoke to
several of my best parishioners, Mr John Maw, Mr Barnard, and
others, that we might be as kind to him as we have been to others,
who have been put apprentices at the public charge, which could
be done but meanly at £5, though his mother should be able to
provide a few shoes and stockings besides for him. I went twice,
on your account and his, to a public meeting at the church, before
I had seen the mother or the boy, but the highest sum we
could bring our people to, in order to make a man of him, was
no more than £3, which I knew was far short of the requisite
amount. On Sunday last I went and talked to Mr John Maw
and Mr Barnard, and we resolved to make up the rest by a
private contribution among ourselves. The next day, I sent for
the lad and his mother to my house, and accordingly they came.
I found he was a lad of spirit, and that he would please you.
I encouraged them both, and told his mother that she might depend
on £5, besides what she herself could do to set him out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>This was all that I could do for him, and if herein I have been
over-officious I hope you will, at least, excuse it from your obliged
friend, <span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a></span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>At this period, General Oglethorpe had become a man of mark
in England. After finishing his education at Corpus Christi College,
Oxford, he was appointed secretary and aide-de-camp to
Prince Eugene, under whom he acted at the famous siege of Belgrade.
While on the Continent, a prince of Wirtemberg, with
whom he was at table, took up a glass of wine, and threw a portion
of its contents into his face. “That’s a good joke, my
prince,” said young Oglethorpe, smiling, “but we do it much
better in England;” and so saying he dashed a glass full of wine
at his Serene Highness in return. Returning to England about
1722, Oglethorpe became member of the House of Commons for
Haslemere, which he represented in five successive parliaments,
from 1722 to 1754. In 1729, having found a friend suffering
most barbarous treatment in the Fleet Prison, and taking the
precedence of John Howard, he called the attention of the House
of Commons to the fact, and was appointed chairman of a committee
to examine into the state of prisons, where cruelties of
the most revolting description had long been practised. About
the same period, some charitable person bequeathed to Oglethorpe
and others a large some of money in trust, to procure the discharge
of poor debtors; and Oglethorpe, soon afterwards, obtained
a grant of £10,000 from government, and also a very liberal
public subscription, to enable the liberated insolvents to emigrate
to Georgia. He proceeded to that country at the head of such a
body of settlers about the year 1733, and returned to England in
1734, bringing with him some Indian chiefs, who were presented
to the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediately after his arrival,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> Mr Wesley addressed to him the
following letter respecting his “Dissertations on the Book of Job;”
and it is possible that this letter was the first of a series of causes,
which, in 1735, led John and Charles Wesley to accompany the
general to his newly-formed colony:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>July 6, 1734</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Honoured Sir</span>,—May I be admitted, while such crowds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>our nobility and gentry are pouring in their congratulations, to
press, with my poor mite of thanks, into the presence of one who
so well deserves the title of Universal Benefactor to mankind. It
is not only your valuable favours on many occasions to my son,
late of Westminster, and to myself, when I was not a little pressed
in the world, nor your more extensive and generous charity to
the poor prisoners; it is not only this that so much demands my
warmest acknowledgments, as your disinterested and immovable
attachment to your country, and your raising a new country, or
rather a little world of your own, in the midst of almost wild
woods and uncultivated deserts, where men may live free and
happy, if they are not hindered by their own stupidity and folly,
in spite of the unkindness of their brother mortals.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither ought I to forget your singular goodness to my little
scholar and parishioner, John Lyndal. Since he went over, I have
received some money for him; and it seems necessary that he
should make a slip hither into Lincolnshire, if you could spare
him for a fortnight or a month, to settle his affairs with his
father’s creditors, which I hope he may now nearly do, and then
he will have a clear estate left of about £6 a-year, to dispose of as
he pleases. I hope he has behaved with such faithfulness and
industry, since he has had the honour and happiness of waiting
upon you, as not to have forfeited the favour of so good a
master.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“I owe you, sir, beside this, some account of my little affairs
since the beginning of your expedition. Notwithstanding my own
and my son’s violent illness, which held me half a year, and him
above a twelvemonth, I have made a shift to get more than three
parts in four of Job<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a> printed off, and both the printing, paper, and
maps hitherto are paid for. My son, John, at Oxford (now his
elder brother is gone to Tiverton) takes care of the remainder of
the impression in London; and I have an ingenious artist here
with me, in my house at Epworth, who is graving and working
off the remaining maps and figures for me, so that I hope, if the
printer does not hinder me, I shall have the whole ready by next
spring, and by God’s leave be in London myself to deliver the
books perfect. I print five hundred copies, as in my proposals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>whereof I have above three hundred already subscribed for; and
among my subscribers, fifteen or sixteen English Bishops, with
some of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not yet done with my own impertinent nostrums. I
thank God I find I creep up hill more than I did formerly, being
eased of the weight of four daughters out of seven, as I hope I
shall of the fifth in a little longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When Mr Lyndal comes down, I shall trouble you by him
with a copy of all the maps and figures which I have yet printed,
they costing me no more than the paper since the graving is
over.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“If you will please herewith to accept the tender of my most

<p class='c001'>The following letter was written to a friend, and shows his
anxiety for the spiritual welfare of all with whom he was acquainted:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth, near Gainsborough</span>, <i>July 11, 1734</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Friend</span>,—Though I have not been worthy to hear from
you, or to have seen any letter of yours since I saw you last, yet I
cannot but retain the same warmth of Christian affection for you
which I conceived at our first sight and acquaintance, as I believe
you did the like for me and mine. Your friend of Queen’s, whom
we call Nathaniel, and who brought us the last good news of your
health, is gone to his relations in Yorkshire, but promises to return
and meet you here, when you and your friends come down to see
us at our fair, in August next. If Charles is short of money, pray
tell him he is welcome to twenty shillings here to make him easier
in his journey. But I think I can tell you of what will please
you more; for last Sunday, at the sacrament, it was darted into
my mind that it was a pity you and your company, while you are
here, should be deprived of the benefit of weekly sacraments
which you enjoy where you are at present; and I therefore resolved,
if you desire it, while you are here, to have the communion
every Sunday; and, lest some of the parish should grumble at it,
the offerings of us who communicate will defray the small expense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>of it. If there be anything else which you can desire, and
which is in my power to grant or procure, you are hereby already
assured of it. If I could write anything kinder, my dear friend,
I would; and I shall see by your acceptance of it, and compliance
with it, whether you believe me, your sincere friend, and half-namesake,

<p class='c001'>The following letter to General Oglethorpe evinces the intense
interest he felt in the colony of Georgia, for which his two sons,
John and Charles, embarked eleven months afterwards:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth, near Gainsborough</span>, <i>Nov. 7, 1734</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Honoured Sir</span>,—I am at length, I thank God, slowly recovering
from a long illness, during which there have been few
days or nights but my heart has been working hard for Georgia,
and for my townsman, John Lyndal. It is in answer to the
favour of yours, and of his last, that I write these to both. I am
extremely concerned lest an inundation of ruin should break in
upon your colony, and destroy that, as it has almost done some
others. But I have some better hopes, because I hear you do not
design to plant it with canes, but with some more innocent, and I
hope, as profitable produce, any of which, whether mulberries or
saffron, I should be glad to hear were begun in Georgia. I confess
I cannot expect God’s blessing, even on the greatest industry,
without true piety and the fear of God. I had always so dear a
love for your colony that if it had been but ten years ago, I
would gladly have devoted the remainder of my life and labours
to that place, and think I might before this time have conquered
the language without which little can be done among the natives,
if the Bishop of London would have done me the honour to have
sent me thither, as perhaps he then might, but that is now over.
However, I can still reach them with my prayers, which I am sure
will never be wanting.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My letter to Mr Lyndal relates to his own particular affairs
here in the country; for though his effects are not large, they
ought by no means to be neglected, and I have given him the
best advice I am able; but if your wisdom should think otherwise,
I desire the letter may be sunk, or else go forward to him by the
next opportunity.</p>

of your affairs at Wroot. I have somewhat above £10
of yours in my hands, and think the best and the honestest way
you could do, would be to pay that money, as far as it will go,
towards the interest of what your father had taken up upon his
estate while he was living. Mr Epworth has brought me a letter
from his mother, wherein she says there was a bond of £10, and
a note of £20, as I remember, due to Mr Epworth’s father. She
desired you would pay off the £10 with interest, and they would
stay for the £20. I told him that could not be done, because
there was so little money amongst us all, and therefore I thought
the fairest and wisest way was to divide the money I had in my
hand, to pay the interest proportionally as far as it would go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for your estate, which is in the tenure of Robert Brumby,
I suppose about £5 or £6 a year, I think it would be best for
you to fix two or three trustees, and make him yearly accountable
to them. If you like it, I will be one of them myself as long as
I live; my son, Whitelamb, would be another; and we think we
could persuade Mr Romley, the schoolmaster, to be the third,
who so well understands the whole matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I find your father owed your uncle, John Barrow, £4, 10s.,
and Goody Stephenson £5. John Barrow is willing to take it
when you can pay him, without interest, and so should Stephenson,
too, but only she is poor, and therefore I will give her five
shillings on your account, if you think fit. Let me hear from you
as soon as you can after the receipt of this.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now I have some little inquiries to make of your new
country. Whether any of our ministers understand their language,
and can preach to them without an interpreter? Whether
they speak the same language with those Indians who are near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>them, of Saltsburg and Carolina; or of those of New England,
who, I know, have the Bible translated into their language?
Whether your Indians have the Lord’s Prayer in their own language?
which, if they have, I desire you would send me a copy
in your next. In all which, especially in loving God and your
neighbour, you would exceedingly oblige, your sincere friend,</p>

days after the burial of Mrs Whitelamb, Mr Wesley’s daughter.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a>
Poor Whitelamb was exceedingly distressed by his sad bereavement,

a month after the former one:—</p>

last kind and instructive letter concerning the affairs of Georgia.
I could not read it over without sighing, when I again reflected on
my own age and infirmities, which made such an expedition utterly
impracticable for me. Yet my mind worked hard about it; and
it is not impossible but Providence may have directed me to such
an expedient as may prove more serviceable to your colony than I
should ever have been.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The thing is thus:—There is a young man, who has been with
me a pretty many years, and assisted me in my work on Job; after
which I sent him to Oxford, to my son, John Wesley, Fellow of
Lincoln College, who took care of his education, where he behaved
himself very well, and improved in piety and learning. Having
got him into deacon’s orders, I sent for him down, and he was my
curate in my absence in London; when I resigned my small living
of Wroot to him, and he was instituted and inducted there. I
likewise consented to his marrying one of my daughters, there
having been a long and intimate friendship between them. But
neither he nor I were so happy as to have them live long together;
for she died in child-bed of her first child. He was so inconsolable
at her loss, that I was afraid he would soon have followed her; to
prevent which, I desired his company here at my own house, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>he might have some amusement and business, by assisting me in
my cure during my illness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was then, sir, I just received the favour of yours, and let him
see it for his diversion; more especially, because John Lyndal and
he had been fellow-parishioners and school-fellows at Wroot, and
had no little kindness one for the other. I made no great reflection
on the thing at first; but, soon after, I found he had thought
often upon it, was very desirous to go to Georgia himself, and wrote
the enclosed letter to me on the subject. As I knew not of any
person more proper for such an undertaking, I thought the least I
could do was to send the letter to your honour, who would be so
very proper a judge of the affair; and, if you approve, I shall not
be wanting in my addresses to my Lord Bishop of London, or any
other, since I expect to be in London myself at spring, to forward
the matter, as far as it will go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for his character, I shall take it upon myself to say, that he
is a good scholar, a sound Christian, and a good liver. He has a
very happy memory, especially for languages, and a judgment and
intelligence not inferior. My eldest son at Tiverton has some
knowledge of him, concerning whom I have writ to him since your
last to me. My two others, his tutor at Lincoln, and my third
of Christ Church, have been long and intimately acquainted with
him; and I doubt not but they will give him, at least, as just a
character as I have done.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And here I shall drop the matter, till I have the honour of
hearing again from you, and shall either drop it or prosecute it,
as appears most proper to your maturer judgment; ever remaining,
your honour’s most sincere, and most obliged friend and servant,
<span class='floatsig'><span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a></span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>These are remarkable and important letters, and doubtless
served as links, in the chain of cause and effect, which led to the
selection of John and Charles Wesley for the mission in Georgia.
The missionary spirit was a passion in the Wesley family, when
Christian missions to the heathen scarce existed. John Wesley,
after being ejected from his church living, in 1662, longed to go
as a missionary, first to Surinam, and afterwards to Maryland.
Samuel Wesley, his son, when a young man of between thirty
and forty years of age, formed a magnificent scheme to go as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>missionary to India, China, and Abyssinia; and, in the last year
of his life, most feelingly laments that he was not young enough
to go to Georgia. His sons, John and Charles, now at Oxford,
caught his spirit, and, within twelve months after the date of the
last letter, actually went. John Whitelamb, his son-in-law, wished
to go; but, for some unknown reason, was kept at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>As already stated, Oglethorpe went to Georgia in 1733, with a
number of released debtors, who were the first settlers in the colony.
These were joined by a number of persecuted Protestants, who had
been driven from Salzburg, a city of Bavaria, by the archbishop of
the place. On October 14, 1735, six months after Samuel Wesley’s
death, Oglethorpe re-embarked for Georgia, with five hundred
and seventy adventurers, among whom were one hundred and thirty
Highlanders, and one hundred and seventy Germans, of whom a
considerable number were Moravians.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a> The trustees of the colony
requested John Wesley and some of his friends to accompany the
emigrants. Wesley consulted his widowed mother. Her answer
was: “Had I twenty sons, I should rejoice they were all so well
employed, though I should never see them more.”<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a> The thing
was settled, and away Wesley went, his brother Charles, and their
Oxford friends, Benjamin Ingham and Charles Delamotte, going
with him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley strongly wished his son John to be his successor
at Epworth; but John, four months before his father’s death, decisively
declined the proposal. He was resolved to remain at
Oxford, because he imagined he could be holier at Oxford than
he could be anywhere else. The rector died, and then his son
changed his mind, and set out on the very mission upon which his
father had set his heart, and to be engaged in which he would, if
he had been ten years younger, have gladly relinquished Epworth
Church. The following letter refers to John Wesley’s final refusal
of his father’s proposition. It was written to Samuel Wesley,
jun., four months previous to Mr Wesley’s decease:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>Dec</i>. 4, 1734.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Son</span>,—Having pretty many things to write to you, and
those of no small moment; and being for the most part confined
to my house by pain and weakness, so that I have not yet ventured
to church on a Sunday, I have just now sat down to try if I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>reduce my thoughts into any tolerable order. Though I can write
but few lines in a day, yet being under my own hand, they may
not be the less acceptable to you.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall throw what I have a mind you shall know, under three
heads—1. What most immediately concerns our own family. 2.
Dick Ellison, the wen of my family, and his poor insects that are
sucking me to death. 3. J. Whitelamb;—and, perhaps, in a postscript,
a little of my own personal affairs, and of the poor.</p>

<p class='c001'>“1. Of our family. Your brother John has at last writ me,
‘that it is now his unalterable resolution not to accept of Epworth
living, if he could have it;’ and the reason he gives for it in these
words:—‘The question is not whether I could do more good to
others <em>there</em> or <em>here</em>, but whether I could do more good to myself;
seeing wherever I can be most holy myself, there, I am assured, I
can most promote holiness in others. But I am equally assured
there is no place under heaven so fit for my improvement as Oxford.
Therefore,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus stands his argument. Though I am no more fond of
the gripping and wrangling distemper than I am of Mr Harper’s<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
boluses and clysters, (for age would again have rest,) I sat myself
down to try if I could unravel his sophisms, and hardly one of his
assertions appeared to me to be universally true. I think the main
of my answer was, that he seemed to mistake the end of academical
studies, which were chiefly preparatory, in order to qualify men
to instruct others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He thinks there is no place so fit for his improvement as Oxford.
As to many sorts of useful knowledge, it may be nearly
true; but surely there need be a knowledge, too, of men and things
(which has not been thought the most attainable in a cloister) as
well as of books, or else we shall find ourselves of much less use
in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the best and greatest improvement is in solid piety and
religion, which (in Oxford) is handy to be got, or promoted, by
being hung up in Socrates’ basket. But allowing that austerity
and mortification may either be a means of promoting holiness, or,
in some degree, a part of it, why may not a man exercise these in
his own house as strictly as in any college, in any university in
Europe, and, perhaps, with less censure and observation? Neither
can I understand the meaning or drift of being thus ever learning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>and never coming to a due proficiency in the knowledge and practice
of the truth, so as to be able commendably to instruct others
in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus far I have written with my own hand, both to you and
your brother, for many days together; but I am now so heartily
tired that I must, contrary to my resolution, get my son Whitelamb
to transcribe and finish it. I have done what I could,
with such a shattered head and body, to satisfy the scruples which
your brother has raised against my proposal, from conscience and
duty; but if your way of thinking be the same with mine, especially
after you have read and weighed what follows, you will be able
to convince him in a much clearer and stronger manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The remaining considerations I offered to him were for the
most part such as follow:—I urged, among other things, the
great precariousness of my own health, and the sensible decay of
my strength, so that he would hardly know me if he saw me now;
the deplorable state in which I should leave your mother and the
family, and the loss of near forty years’ honest labour in this place,
where I could expect no other, but that the field which I have been
so long sowing with good seed, and the vineyard, which I have
planted with no ignoble vine, must be soon rooted up, and the
fences of it broken down,—for I am morally satisfied, if your
brothers both slight it, Mr P—— will be my successor.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hinted at one thing, which I mentioned in my letter to your
brother, whereon I depend more than upon all my own simple
reasoning; and that is, earnest prayer to Him who smiles at the
strongest resolutions of mortals, and can, in a moment, change or
demolish them; who alone can bend the inflexible sinew, and order
the irregular wills of us simple men to His own glory, and to our
happiness. While the anchor holds, I despair of nothing, but
firmly believe that He who is best will do what is best, whether
we earnestly will it or will it not. There I rest the whole matter,
and leave it with Him, to whom I have committed all my concerns,
without exception and without reserve, for soul and body, estate
and family, time and eternity.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>“2. As to the second part of my letter concerning R. Ellison,<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
I have charity crammed down my throat every day, and sometimes
his company at meals, which you will believe as pleasant to
me as all my physic. But this is beyond the reach of all my
little prudence, and therefore I find I must leave it as I have
done, in some good measure before, to Him who orders all
things.</p>

<p class='c001'>“3. The third part of my letter is in relation to my son Whitelamb,
and is of almost as great concern as the former, and on
some accounts perhaps greater.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> You will find the whole affair
contained in a letter I lately sent to Mr Oglethorpe, and in my
son Whitelamb’s to myself. The letters are so full, that they
have exhausted what we had to say on that subject; and nothing
at present need or can be added. I desire you therefore to weigh
the whole with the utmost impartiality; and, if you are of the
same mind with myself and your mother, who entirely approves
of the design, that you would yourself write to Mr Oglethorpe,
as I promised you would, and send him your thoughts, and use
your good offices about it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now, as to my minute affairs, I doubt not but you will,
as you gave me hopes when you went into Devon, improve your
interest among the gentlemen, your friends, and get me some
more subscribers, as likewise an account whether there be any
prospect yet remaining of obtaining any favour from the Duke
of Newcastle, in relation to the affair.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a>—Yours,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The last letter we shall introduce is a review of his life, and
therefore an appropriate conclusion of the present chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been already mentioned that Mr Wesley had a brother,
named Matthew,Jwho practised as a physician in London. There
does not appear to have been much intimacy between the two
brothers; but, after the fire at Epworth in 1709, Matthew took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>to his house his brother’s two children, Hetty and Susan; and
afterwards in 1720, he, in a similar manner, took Patty, who lived
in his house for twelve years, and to whom, on her marriage, he
gave a dowry of £500. Matthew Wesley was a man of considerable
wealth; but he had obtained it by unwearied diligence, and
by the utmost economy. He knew next to nothing of the
troubles of a family, and was ill-qualified to judge of family
expenses.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1731, accompanied by his man-servant, he started from
London to Epworth on a visit to his brother. He travelled under
a feigned name, and intended to take his brother by surprise;
but his man not being so taciturn as himself, the secret oozed out,
and the family were prepared for his coming. The first day after
his arrival he spoke little to the children, being employed in observing
their behaviour, so that he might know how he ought to
like them. He was strangely scandalised at the poor furniture of
the parsonage, and at the meanness of the children’s clothing,
and wondered what his brother had done with all his income.
He always behaved himself decently at family prayers, and, when
Mr Wesley was absent, said grace before and after meat. On his
return to London, he wrote a severe and caustic letter to his
brother, accusing him of bad economy, and of not making provision
for his large family. Part of this strange epistle was as
follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“The same record which assures us an infidel cannot inherit
the kingdom of heaven, also asserts, in the consequence, that a
worse than infidel can never do it. It likewise describes the
character of such a one: ‘He provides not for his own, especially
for those of his own house.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have a numerous offspring; you have had a long time a
plentiful estate, and have made no provision for those of your
own house, who can have nothing in view at your exit but distress.
This I think a black account; let the cause be folly, or vanity, or
ungovernable appetites. I hope Providence has restored you again
to give you time to settle this balance, which shocks me to think
of. To this end, I must advise you to be frequent in your perusal
of Father Beveridge on <cite>Repentance</cite>, and Dr Tillotson on
<cite>Restitution</cite>; for it is not saying Lord, Lord, will bring us to the
kingdom of heaven, but doing justice to all our fellow-creatures;
and not a poetical imagination that we do so. A serious consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>of these things, and suitable actions, I doubt not, will
qualify you to meet me where sorrow shall be no more, which is
the highest hope and expectation of yours,</p>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Matthew Wesley</span>.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This is an unjust, unfeeling, disreputable letter, and it is
certainly surprising that Mehetabel Wesley, when her uncle died
six years after, should have so eulogised his character as she did,
in her elegy, published in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for 1737.
He might be a man of much learning and information, a good judge
and lover of poetry, and clever in his profession; but the above
epistle makes one doubt that he was “a man of truly benevolent
mind,” and prepares one to receive Patty Wesley’s statement respecting
him, written a year before the time of his Epworth visit,
viz., that he was not converted, nor what he ought to be.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a> He
seems to have been highly esteemed for his professional ability
and services; but a stranger to pure, earnest, heartfelt godliness.
He treated John Wesley’s mission to Georgia with ridicule, and
told Charles that, “if the French had any remarkably dull fellow
among them, they sent him to convert the Indians.” Charles
says he checked and silenced his uncle’s art and eloquence by
repeating the lines of his brother:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To distant realms the apostle need not roam,</div>
      <div class='line'>Darkness, alas! and heathens are at home.”<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>A few months before his death, Samuel Wesley replied to his
brother’s accusations, in a long letter, twenty lines of which were
written by himself, about one-half of it by Mrs Wesley, and
the remainder by his son John, who acted as his amanuenses.
The letter, which is without date, is written in a serio-jocose style,
and is headed “John o’ Styles’ Apology against the imputation of
his ill husbandry.” A friend is represented as reading Matthew
Wesley’s letter to his brother, John o’ Styles, and as reporting
the brother’s answer to the charges brought against him. The
pretended narrator says:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“When I had read this to my friend John o’ Styles, I was a
little surprised that he did not fall into flouncing and bouncing,
as I have too often seen him do on far less provocation, which I
ascribed to a fit of sickness he had lately had, and which I hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>may have brought him to something of a better mind. He stood
calm and composed for a minute or two, and then desired he
might peruse the letter, adding, that if the matter of fact therein
were true, and not aggravated or misrepresented, he was obliged
in conscience to acknowledge it, and ask pardon at least of his
family, if he could make them no other satisfaction. If it were
not true, he owed that justice to himself and his family, to clear
himself of so vile an imputation. After he had read it over he
said he did not think it necessary to enter into a detail of the
history of his whole life, from sixteen to upwards of seventy; but
he would make some general observations on those general accusations
which have been brought against him, and then would add
some balance of his incomes and expenses ever since he entered
on the stage of life.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sum of the libel may be reduced to the following assertions:—1.
That John o’ Styles is worse than an infidel, and
therefore can never go to heaven; which secondly, he aims at proving,
because he provides not for his own house; as notorious instances
of which, he adds, in the third place, that in the pursuits
of his pleasures he had produced a numerous offspring, and has
had a long time a plentiful estate, and great and generous benefactors,
but yet has made no provision for those of his own house;
which he thinks, in the last place, a black account, let the cause
be folly, or vanity, or his own irregular passions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>Answer.</i>—If God has blessed him with a numerous offspring,
he has no reason to be ashamed of them, nor they of him, unless
perhaps one of them. Neither does his conscience accuse him
that he has made no provision for those of his own house; which
general accusation includes them all. But has he none, nay, not
above one, two, or three, to whom he has given the best education
which England could afford, by God’s blessing on which they
live honourably and comfortably in the world? Some of them
had already been a considerable help to the others, as well as to
himself; and he has no reason to doubt the same of the rest, as
soon as God shall enable them to do it. There are many gentlemen’s
families in England who, by the same method, provide for
their younger children; and he hardly thinks that there are many
of greater estates but would be glad to change the best of theirs,
or even all their stock, for almost the worst of his.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither is he ashamed in claiming some merit in his having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>been so happy in breeding them up in his own principles and
practices—not only the priests in his family, but all the rest—to a
steady opposition and confederacy against all such as are avowed
and declared enemies to God and his clergy, and who deny or disbelieve
any articles of natural or revealed religion, as well as to such
as are open or secret friends to the Great Rebellion, or to any such
principles as do but squint towards the same practices; so that
he hopes they are all staunch High-Church, and for inviolable passive
obedience;<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c014'><sup>[334]</sup></a> from which, if any of them should be so wicked
as to degenerate, he cannot tell whether he could prevail with
himself to give them his blessing; though, at the same time, he
almost equally abhors all servile submission to the greatest and
most overgrown tool of State, whose avowed design it is to aggrandise
his prince at the expense of the liberties and properties of his
freeborn subjects.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus much for John o’ Styles’ ecclesiastical and political
creed; and, as he hopes, for those of his family. And as his
adversary adds, that ‘at his exit they could have nothing in view
but distress, and that it is a black account, let the cause be folly,
or vanity, or ungovernable appetites;’ John o’ Styles answered:
He has not the least doubt of God’s provision for his family after
his decease, if they continue in the way of righteousness. As for
his folly, he owns he can hardly demur to the charge; for he
fairly acknowledges he never was, nor ever will be, like the children
of this world, who are accounted wise in their generation, in
doting upon this world, courting this world, and regarding nothing
else: not but that he has all his life laboured truly both with his
hands, head, and heart, to provide things honest in the sight of
all men, to get his own living, and that of those who have been
dependents on him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for his vanity, he challenges an instance to be given of
any extravagance in any single branch of his expenses through
the whole course of his life, either in dress, diet, horses, recreation,
or diversion, either in himself or family.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now if these, which are the main objections, are wiped off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>what becomes of the black account, or of the worse than infidelity
which this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Severus Frater et Avunculus Puerorum</i></span> has, in the
plenitude of his power, urged, to exclude those, who, for want of
equal illumination or equal estates, think or act differently from
himself, out of the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for the plentiful estates, and great and generous benefactions
which he likewise mentions, the person accused answered,
that he could never acknowledge as he ought the goodness of
God and of his generous benefactors; but hopes he may add, that
he had never tasted so much of their kindness if they had not
believed him to be an honest man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus much he said in general, but added as to particular
instances, he should only add a blank balance, and leave it to any
after his death to cast it up according to common equity; and
then they would be more proper judges whether he deserved those
imputations which are now thrown upon him.</p>

valued at £200 per annum, where he remained for nearly forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>years, and wherein his numerous offspring amounted, with the
former, to eighteen or nineteen children.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Half of his parsonage was first burnt, which he rebuilt: some
time after the whole was burnt to the ground, which he rebuilt
from the foundations; and it cost him above £400, besides the
furniture, none of which was saved, and he was forced to renew it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“About ten years since, he got a little living adjoining to his
former, the profits of which very little more than defrayed the
expenses of serving it, and sometimes hardly so much; his whole
tithe having been in a manner swept away by inundations, for
which the parishioners had a brief, though he thought it not
decent for himself to be joined with them in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For the greater part of these last ten years, he has been closely
employed in composing a large book, whereby he hoped he might
have done some benefit to the world, and in some measure
amended his own fortunes. By sticking so close to this, he has
broke a pretty strong constitution, and fallen into palsy and gout.
Besides this, he has had sickness in his family for most of the
years since he was married.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His greater living seldom cleared above £160 per annum,
out of which he allowed £20 per annum to a person who had
married one of his daughters. Could we on the whole fix the
balance, it would easily appear whether he had been an ill husband,
or careless and idle, and taken no care of his family. Let
us range on the one side his income, and on the other his expenses
while he has been at the top of his fortunes, taking them at the
full extent:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was one of the last letters that Samuel Wesley ever wrote;
or rather, we ought to say dictated, for such were his afflictions
and weakness, that nearly the whole of it had to be written by his
wife and by his second son, who penned it from his lips. It is an
ample refutation of the unnatural charges brought against him by
his brother; and scatters to the winds the vague ideas of all those
who, in modern times, have been apt to think of Samuel Wesley
as being, upon the whole, a good-hearted sort of man; but, at the
same time, in some way, a spendthrift, and one who very culpably
neglected the interests of his wife and family. All this is unfounded,
unjust, and cruel; the result, not of research, but of
indolent ignorance, which has too readily taken for granted, that
which it ought, first of all, to have examined.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br />DEATH AND CHARACTER—1735.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr Wesley never fully recovered from the effects of the serious
accident which befell him in 1731. The reader will have perceived
this in the letters given in the previous chapter. Mrs Wesley,
writing to her son John, says, “Your father is in a very bad state
of health; he sleeps little and eats less. He seems not to have
any apprehension of his approaching exit, but I fear he has but a
short time to live. It is with much pain and difficulty that he
performs divine service on the Lord’s-day, which sometimes he
is obliged to contract very much. Everybody observes his decay
but himself.”<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c014'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Wesley had a severe illness about the year 1733, which
totally disabled him for six months. The first two sermons he
preached after this affliction were from the words, “Jesus findeth
him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made
whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee,” (John
v. 14.)</p>

<p class='c001'>The last two sermons, noted in his memorandum-book, were
preached at Epworth, August 18, 1734, on 1 Sam. xii. 17: “Is it
not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto the Lord,” &amp;c. After
showing that unseasonable weather, in time of harvest, is a just
judgment inflicted by the hand of God for the wickedness of the
people, he proceeds to address his congregation thus:—“I am
afraid, nay, too well assured, that many of you have hardened
your hearts as did Pharaoh; for otherwise, how came the house of
God so empty here last Sunday? The people went in shameful
droves to do their own ways, and find their own pleasures, and
speak their own words; and left a very small flock behind them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>on their knees to cry mightily to God that He would have mercy
upon us, that we might not perish.”<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c014'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There is no evidence that Mr Wesley preached after this. His
death-bed scene was exquisitely beautiful. His sons, John and
Charles, were present, and from both of them we have accounts
of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley, in a letter dated March 22, 1748, and supposed
to be written to Archbishop Secker, says:—“My father did not
die unacquainted with the faith of the gospel, of the primitive
Christians, or of our first Reformers; the same which, by the
grace of God, I preach, and which is just as new as Christianity.
What he experienced before I know not; but I know that, during
his last illness, which continued eight months, he enjoyed a clear
sense of his acceptance with God. I heard him express it more
than once, although, at that time, I understood him not. ‘The
inward witness, son, the inward witness,’ said he to me, ‘that is
the proof, the strongest proof of Christianity.’ And when I asked
him (the time of his change drawing nigh), ‘Sir, are you in much
pain?’ He answered aloud with a smile, ‘God does chasten me
with pain, yea, all my bones with strong pain; but I thank Him
for all, I bless Him for all, I love Him for all!’ I think the last
words he spoke, when I had just commended his soul to God,
were, ‘Now you have done all;’ and, with the same serene, cheerful
countenance, he fell asleep without one struggle, or sigh, or
groan. I cannot therefore doubt but the Spirit of God bore an
inward witness with his spirit that he was a child of God.”<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c014'><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John Wesley, in his sermon on Love, preached at Savannah
in 1736, again adverts to his father’s death, and says:—“When
asked, not long before his release, ‘Are the consolations of God
small with you?’ He replied aloud, ‘No, no, no!’ and then calling
all that were near him by their names, he said, ‘Think of
heaven, talk of heaven; all the time is lost when we are not thinking
of heaven.’”<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c014'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Charles Wesley’s description of his father’s death is more
lengthened, and is contained in a letter addressed to his brother
Samuel, and which was first published by Dr Priestley in 1791.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>The letter was written two days after the funeral, and is as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Epworth</span>, <i>April 30, 1735</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Brother</span>,—After all your desire of seeing my father
alive, you are at last assured you must see his face no more till
he is raised in incorruption. You have reason to envy us, who
could attend him in the last stage of his illness. The few words
he could utter I saved, and hope never to forget. Some of them
were, ‘Nothing too much to suffer for heaven. The weaker I am
in body, the stronger and more sensible support I feel from God.
There is but a step between me and death. To-morrow I will
see you all with me round this table, that we may once more drink
of the cup of blessing before we drink of it new in the kingdom
of God. With desire have I desired to eat this passover with you
before I die.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The morning he was to communicate, he was so exceeding
weak and full of pain, that he could not, without the utmost difficulty,
receive the elements, often repeating, ‘Thou shakest me,
thou shakest me;’ but, immediately after receiving, there followed
the most visible alteration. He appeared full of faith and peace,
which extended even to his body, for he was so much better that
we almost hoped he would have recovered.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c014'><sup>[342]</sup></a> The fear of death
he had entirely conquered, and at last gave up his latest human
desires of finishing Job, paying his debts, and seeing you. He
often laid his hand upon my head and said, ‘Be steady. The
Christian faith will surely revive in this kingdom; you shall see
it, though I shall not.’<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c014'><sup>[343]</sup></a> To my sister Emily, he said, ‘Do not be
concerned at my death, God will then begin to manifest himself
to my family.’<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c014'><sup>[344]</sup></a> On my asking him whether he did not find himself
worse, he replied, ‘Oh my Charles, I feel a great deal, God
chastens me with strong pain, but I praise Him for it, I thank
Him for it, I love Him for it.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the 25th his voice failed him, and nature seemed entirely
spent, when, on my brother’s asking, ‘Whether he was not near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>heaven?’ he answered distinctly, and with the most of hope and
triumph that could be expressed in sounds, ‘Yes, I am.’ He
spoke once more, just after my brother had used the commendatory
prayer; his last words were, ‘Now, you have done all!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“This was about half an hour after six, from which time till
sunset he made signs of offering up himself, till my brother,
having again used the prayer, the very moment it was finished,
he expired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His passage was so smooth and insensible that, notwithstanding
the stopping of his pulse, and ceasing of all sign of life and
motion, we continued over him a considerable time in doubt
whether the soul was departed or no. My mother (who for
several days before he died, hardly ever went into his chamber
but she was carried out again in a fit) was far less shocked at the
news than we expected, and told us that now she was heard, in
his having so easy a death, and in her being strengthened so to
bear it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My brother had laid aside all hopes or fears (for I cannot certainly
say which) of succeeding; but, by yours, we guess Mr Oglethorpe
has quickened him. A petition might easily be sent if now
necessary. A neighbouring clergyman has sent word that ‘he
has the living,’ which would be bad news, but that another as
confidently affirms he has it. How many more may be sure of it
we cannot say, but if Providence pleases a Wesley will have it
after all, though in the gift of the crown. I hope, and so does my
brother, that you will have their wish, and that he may fail of his.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Though you have lost your chief reason for coming, yet there
are others which make your presence more necessary than ever.
My mother, who will hardly ever leave Epworth, would be exceedingly
glad to see you as soon as can be. She does not administer,
so can neither sue nor be sued. We have computed the debts as
near as can be, and find they amount to about £100, exclusive of
cousin Richardson’s. Mrs Knight, her landlady, seized all her
quick stock, valued at above £40 for £15 my father owed her
on Monday last, the day he was buried; and my brother this
afternoon gives a note for the money, in order to get the stock at
liberty to sell; for security of which he has the stock made over
to him, and will be paid as it can be sold. My father was buried
very frugally, yet decently, in the churchyard according to his own
desire. It will be highly necessary to bring all accounts of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>he owed you, that you may mark all the goods in the house as
principal creditor, and thereby secure to my mother time and
liberty to sell them to the best advantage. All papers and letters
of importance I have sealed up and keep till you come.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you take London in your way, my mother desires you would
remember she is a clergyman’s widow. Let the society give her
what they please—she must be still in some degree <em>burdensome</em> to
you, as she calls it. How do I envy you that glorious burden,
and wish I could share it. You must put me in some way of
getting a little money, that I may do something in this shipwreck
of the family, for somebody, though it be no more than furnishing
a plank.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My mother sends her love and blessing; we all send our love
to you, and to my sister and Phill. I should be ashamed of having
so much business in my letter were it not necessary. I would
choose to write and think of nothing but my father. Before we
meet I hope you will have finished his elegy. Pray write if there
be time.—I am, your most affectionate brother,</p>

<p class='c016'>The poetry of the Epworth rector has unquestionably been
“slighted and derided,” and it must be honestly confessed that
some of his verses are exceedingly careless and inharmonious;
but this was not so much the fault of the man’s poetic genius, as
of his too great haste in writing them. His poems were written
amid the pressure of parochial duties; and, we incline to think,
sometimes when he was hard pushed for want of food and clothes
for himself and family. Even his most hasty and unfinished pieces
flash with the purest poetic fire, and are not without signs that the
man who wrote them was a bard of the highest order. It was
from him that his three sons, Samuel, John, and Charles, and his
two daughters, Emilia and Mehetabel, inherited that remarkable
poetic passion, which gave birth to some of the finest verse in the
English language. Copious extracts from his poetry have been
already given; but as yet no mention has been made of his
“Eupolis’s Hymn to the Creator.”<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c014'><sup>[348]</sup></a> Dr Adam Clarke pronounces
this poem to be “the finest on the subject in the English language.
It possesses what Racine calls the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>genie createur</i></span>, the genuine spirit
of poetry. It is not saying too much to assert, the man who was
the author of what is called ‘Eupolis’s Hymn to the Creator,’ had
he taken time, care, and pains, and had not been continually harassed
with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>res augusta domi</i></span>, would have adorned the highest
walks of poetry.”<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c014'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>Mr Wesley was a man of immense reading, and was possessed
of great vivacity and wit. Sometimes he has been represented as
of a harsh and stern character; but nothing can be farther from
the truth than this—“His children,” says Miss Wesley, his granddaughter,
“idolised his memory.” They would scarce have done
that if he had been ungenial and gruff. It is true, he kept his
children in the strictest order; but he also evinced the greatest
tenderness, and thus secured both the respect and love of his
numerous family. To his judicious method of instructing and
managing his offspring, the Methodists owe an incalculable debt
of gratitude; and, on this account, his name among them ought to
be held in lasting remembrance. He was full of anecdote, and of
witty and wise sayings, which gave to his private conversations
great interest. The withering wit of his son Samuel, the quiet
sarcasm of his son John, the playful raillery of his daughter
Emilia, and the keen satire of Mehetabel, were all inherited from
himself. In early life he was connected with some of the greatest
wits then flourishing, and to the day of his death highly relished
pleasantry, when it was pure and good-tempered.</p>

<p class='c001'>One instance, given by Dr Adam Clarke, is as follows:—At
Temple Belwood, near Epworth, lived a miserly man, who, contrary
to the whole tenor of his life, once mustered courage enough
to invite a few friends to dinner. Mr Wesley was present, and
displayed his wit, and his great facility in composition, by repeating,
impromptu, at the close of such an unusual festival:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thanks for this feast! for ’tis no less</div>
      <div class='line'>Than eating manna in the wilderness.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here some have starved, where we have found relief,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seen the wonders of a chine of beef.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here chimneys smoke, which never smoked before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we have dined, where we shall dine no more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Which last line was immediately confirmed by the mean-spirited
host, who said, “No, gentlemen; it is too expensive.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr Clarke relates another story, which was somewhat severely
criticised in the <cite>Methodist Magazine</cite> for 1824; was corrected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>Mr Watson in his Life of Wesley, in 1831; and has been sharply
handled by Mr Kirk, in his graphic biography of 1864. Because
the story has excited so much attention, I feel bound to give it.
Dr Clarke says he has related the story, as nearly as possible, in
the very words used by John Wesley to himself, when they last
met in Bristol.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Wesley had a clerk, who was well-meaning and honest,
but, at the same time, weak and vain. Of this, an instance is given
somewhat ludicrous. It is said, that on the return of King
William from one of his martial expeditions, this self-conceited
official rose up, in the midst of divine service, in Epworth church,
and, with the nasal twang usual among such functionaries, and to
the unfortunate amusement of the congregation, said—“Let us
sing, to the praise and glory of God, a hymn of my own composing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“King William is come home, come home,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>King William home is come;</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore let us together sing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The hymn that is called ‘Te D’um.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This poetical clerk believed the rector, Mr Wesley, to be the
greatest man in Epworth parish; and that, as he stood next to
him in church services, he was also next in worth and dignity.
Among the man’s other emoluments was the privilege of wearing
the rector’s cast-off clothes and wigs, for the latter of which his
head was far too small. Mr Wesley, finding him particularly vain
of one of these wigs, formed the design to mortify him in the
presence of the congregation. One morning, before church time,
Mr Wesley said, “John, I shall preach on a particular subject to-day;
and shall choose my own psalm, of which I shall give out
the first line, and you shall proceed as usual.” Accordingly the
service went forward as it was wont to do, till the time came for
singing, when Mr Wesley gave out the following line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Like to an owl in ivy bush”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This was sung, and then John, peeping out of his large canonical
wig, proceeded with the next line, and, in the orthodox twang,
drawled out—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That rueful thing am I!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The congregation, struck with John’s appearance, saw the ludicrousness
of the coincidence, and, to John’s great mortification, burst
into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>Such is Dr Clarke’s version of the story. The reviewer in the
magazine objects to it—first, Because it was too trivial to merit a
place in such a work; second, Because it reflects upon the good-nature
of Mr Wesley, and upon his attention to that uniform dignity and
seriousness of demeanour which are justly expected from a Christian
minister; and third, Because, in one important particular, the
story was untrue, for Mr Wesley took no part in the business whatever;
but the whole was the culpable trick of the whimsical clerk,
who chose such an opportunity of rendering himself ridiculous,
and of making his neighbours laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Watson admits that the anecdote is laughable enough, but
says, it “implicates Mr Wesley in an irreverent act in the house
of God, of which he was not capable;” and moreover, “Mr Wesley
had no hand in selecting the psalm, which appears to have been
purely accidental.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Kirk takes the same view, and further, doubts whether such
lines were ever read at all; or, if they were, he suggests that they
must have been part of another hymn of the clerk’s “own composing.”
Perhaps so; Mr Kirk says neither he nor his friends
have been able to find anything like the lines in either Sternhold
and Hopkins, or in any other of the “old versions” of the Psalms.
This is quite correct, and we believe that the exact lines above recited
cannot be found in any “version;” but the following occur
in an edition of Sternhold’s, published in 1729, and now before
us:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And as an owl in desert is,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lo, I am such an one;</div>
      <div class='line'>I watch, and as a sparrow on</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The house-top am alone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The origin of the doubts respecting the authenticity of the story
may be found in the following letter, published in the <cite>Wesleyan
Times</cite> newspaper of March 7, 1864. It was written to Dr Clarke
by Miss Sarah Wesley, at the time he published his “Wesley
Family:”—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c004'>“<i>May 28, 1822.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Doctor</span>,—I omitted to mention one material circumstance
in my last, relative to the clerk and his psalm, as I well
remember hearing my good father, ‘(the Rev. Charles Wesley,)’
relate it to us.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was not by my grandfather’s appointment he gave it out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>but from the clerk’s own sagacity, little suspecting the old Caxon
resembled him to an owl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, a pious pastor would not have excited a laugh in a
sacred place, or punished a silly blockhead at the expense of interrupting
the devotion of a whole congregation; but as anecdotes
never lose by tradition, you have heard it was design, not accident.
Dean Swift might have done so, but not Samuel Wesley, senior,
who had ever inculcated the duty, even in psalmody, of worshipping
the Lord with reverence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear father told me the circumstance when pointing out to
us the follies to which vanity exposed a man, and the effects they
produced. But my worthy grandfather could not, consistent with
his respect to the sacred place, have directed a silly man to divert
his audience. Accidentally it was indeed ludicrous, and might
have cured him of a little innocent vanity, for all the people saw
the resemblance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never recollected, till my last letter went, that I had left out
this statement, and hope it will come time enough for the fact to
be mentioned as it was; for, otherwise, there is a shade cast on my
good old ancestor which no wit can chase away.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In another letter to Dr Clarke, dated “Jan. 24, 1824,” the same
writer says:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Your authority for John, the clerk, is my dear uncle; ours, my
father and Aunt Hall, who, had they lived, I doubt not, would have
stood to their account of the circumstance, and contested it with
their good brother; who, when he related it to you, was considerably
advanced in years, and far more likely to misplace circumstances,
with such a weight of business and years, than my father
or aunt, who had made us acquainted with the anecdote in the
vigour of their memory. If it were as you state, I am persuaded had
my dear uncle been younger, he never would have related (without
disapprobation, even of his own parent) such conduct in a church.”<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c014'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Dr Clarke still adhered to the correctness of his version of the
story, and defended the action on the ground that “it was the only
way in which a weak, well-meaning, but vain man, could be cured
of a vanity discreditable to himself and troublesome to others;”
and that “the means employed were as innocent, as they were
appropriate and efficient.” He also justifies his publication of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>anecdote, because he thought the thing was “characteristic of the
man;” that it is “from facts of this nature that the biographer forms
a proper estimate of the character he describes;” and that, without
“such incidents,” he must “plod on in dry detail of facts,” in a
manner “little pleasing to himself,” and almost “unsupportable to
his readers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is all that the writer knows respecting this paltry business,
which has become far more important than it deserves to be. It
has already occupied too much of the writer’s space, and hence,
without any comment of his own, he leaves the ingenious reader
to form his own opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Matthew Wesley, in the letter already quoted in the previous
chapter, insinuates that his brother had indulged in “ungovernable
appetites.” This was an unfounded and cruel accusation.
In all respects, Samuel Wesley was a most temperate and frugal
man, except, perhaps, in his indulgence of snuff and tobacco.</p>

<p class='c001'>Living in the midst of Lincolnshire fens, it is not surprising
that he used the pipe; for the belief was common that it helped
to prevent disease. It is not improbable, however, that the weed
was an early friend; for, in the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, while the
editors allow that tobacco when immoderately used is insalubrious,
they also, as is usual with smokers, contend that, when
properly employed, it helps to cure headaches, toothaches, asthmas,
and old coughs; and though it might induce drinking, yet so did
the eating of bread and cheese or Westphalia ham. Snuff, however,
seems to have been Mr Wesley’s favourite indulgence; and
on this account he was, perhaps, undutifully attacked by his son,
Samuel, as early as the year 1714, in one of the keenest satires that
the young poet ever penned. Speaking of the box, he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The snuff-box first provokes our just disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>That rival of the fan and of the cane.</div>
      <div class='line'>Your modern beaux to richest shrines intrust</div>
      <div class='line'>Their worthless stores of fashionable dust.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And again of snuff itself:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Strange is the power of snuff, whose pungent grains</div>
      <div class='line'>Can make fops speak, and furnish beaux with brains;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor care of cleanliness, nor love of dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can save their clothes from brick-dust nastiness.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some think the part too small of modish sand</div>
      <div class='line'>Which at a niggard pinch they can command;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can their fingers for that task suffice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their nose too greedy, not their hands too nice;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>To such a height with these is fashion grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>They feed their very nostrils with a spoon.</div>
      <div class='line'>One, and but one degree is wanting yet,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make our senseless luxury complete;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some choice regale, useless as snuff, and dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>To feed the mazy windings of the ear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This withering satire was written by young Wesley at the
request of his aunt, Ann Annesley, and for it he makes a graceful
and not unneeded apology to his father. Mr Kirk thinks that,
because of his embarrassments, Samuel Wesley ought to have
dispensed with the luxuries of the pipe and of snuff; but perhaps
if Mr Kirk himself had ever used them, his opinion would have
been somewhat modified. John Wesley says the use of tobacco
is “an uncleanly and unwholesome self-indulgence;” and that
the use of snuff is “a silly, nasty, dirty custom.”<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c014'><sup>[351]</sup></a> He enacted
a law, making it imperative that on no account should any of his
preachers take snuff, and that they should strongly dissuade the
Methodists from taking it, and should answer all their pretences
for doing so, and especially the pretence that it cured the colic.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c014'><sup>[352]</sup></a>
He directed that, on receiving “new helpers” at Conference,
solemn fasting and prayer should be used, and this question
among others be proposed to the presented candidates, “Do you
take no snuff, tobacco, drams?”<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c014'><sup>[353]</sup></a> We have not a syllable to say
against all this. We believe that, for medical purposes, smoking
and snuffing have no good in them; and, moreover, we share in
the disgust felt by thousands of intelligent and good people at
seeing so many empty-headed boys of the present generation
attempting to deceive the public, and to make them believe that
they are men, because they happen to have the audacity to cultivate
a jagged moustache, and to smoke a pipe; yet, considering
the sequestered life which Mr Wesley lived, and considering
the almost unceasing troubles through which he had to pass, we
can easily excuse his seeking, at so insignificant an expense, the
sort of soothing stupor or cerebral solace, which, as old smokers
and old snuffers tell us, is derivable from the much abused, fragrant
weed, tobacco.</p>

<p class='c001'>For forty-seven years Mr Wesley was a diligent, faithful minister
of Christ.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As a pastor,” says Dr Whitehead, “he was indefatigable in
the duties of his office: a constant preacher, feeding the flock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>with the pure doctrines of the gospel; and diligent in visiting the
sick, and administering such advice as their situations required.
This integrity was conspicuous, and his conduct uniform. Few
men have been so diligent in the pastoral office as he was; none
perhaps more so. Though his income was small, and his family
large, he had always something to give to those in distress. In
conversation he was grave, yet instructive, lively, and full of
anecdote. His last moments were as conspicuous for resignation
and Christian fortitude, as his life had been for zeal and diligence.”<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c014'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr Wesley,” says the Rev. John Hampson, “was a voluminous
writer. He was the author of a Latin Comment on Job; a
work of much erudition, and perhaps for that reason but little
read. He also wrote the History of the Bible, and the Life of
Christ in verse, with several smaller pieces. His larger poems
were rather injurious than advantageous to his reputation; and,
instead of increasing his estimation with the public, exposed him
to the derision of the wits, and the censure of the critics.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c014'><sup>[355]</sup></a> But
Mr Wesley’s talents as a writer are the least of his praise. He
was not merely a man of learning and ability. His piety and
integrity were striking and exemplary. He was given to hospitality;
and in every respect a most excellent parish priest. The
last moments of this valuable man were crowned with most striking
fortitude, magnanimity, and Christian resignation. It is no
exaggeration to say, that a better man, or a more vigilant and
faithful pastor, he did not leave behind him. He united the zeal
and courage of a martyr, with the simplicity and evangelical spirit
of an apostle; and though he had no great cause to boast the
munificence, he possessed the esteem of some of the first characters
in the nation.”<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c014'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Samuel Wesley,” says Dr Clarke, “was of a short stature; of
a spare, but athletic make; and nearly resembled in person his son
John. It is likely that the picture prefixed to his ‘Dissertations on
the Book of Job’ was a correct resemblance of him.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c014'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>“He was earnest, conscientious, and indefatigable in his search
after truth. He thought deeply on every subject which was either
to form an article in his creed, or a principle for his conduct. His
orthodoxy was pure and solid; his religious conduct strictly correct;
his piety towards God ardent; his loyalty to his king unsullied;
and his love to his fellow-creatures strong and unconfined. Though
of High Church principles and High Church politics,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c014'><sup>[358]</sup></a> yet he could
separate the <em>man</em> from the <em>opinions</em> he held, and when he found
him in distress, knew him only as a friend and brother. He was
a rigid disciplinarian, both in his church and his family. He knew
all his parishioners. He visited them from house to house; he
sifted their creed, and permitted none to be corrupt in their opinions
or in their practices, without instruction or reproof. In this manner
he went through his parish, which was near three miles long,
three times; and he was visiting it the fourth time round when he
fell into his last sickness.”<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c014'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing more is needed. In the foregoing testimonies the
writer heartily concurs. Mr Wesley’s behaviour, as a parish clergyman,
was in all respects exemplary excepting one; we mean his
enforcement of canonical laws concerning penance, the neglect of
which, we are bound to say, would have been more virtuous than
the observance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Remarks have sometimes been made to the effect that Mr Wesley’s
labours were honoured with but small success; and, in support
of this, the testimony of his son John is quoted, but quoted
only in part. The entire entry in his journal is as follows:—“1742.
Sunday, June 13.—I preached in Epworth churchyard
to a vast multitude, gathered together from all parts. I continued
among them for near three hours, and yet we scarce knew how to
part. Oh, let none think his labour of love is lost because the fruit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>does not immediately appear! Near forty years did my father
labour here, but he saw little fruit of all his labour. I took some
pains among this people too, and my strength also seemed spent
in vain; but now the fruit appeared. There were scarce any in
the town on whom either my father or I had taken any pains formerly,
but the seed, sown so long since, now sprung up, bringing
forth repentance and remission of sins.”<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c014'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If this testimony of John Wesley means what it says, it means
that the labours of his father at Epworth, so far from being barren,
were crowned with great results; only the results were more visible
after his death than they were before.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have already seen that Mr Wesley outlived the brutal hostility
with which he was met during the first years of his residence
at Epworth, and that his dozen communicants had increased to
above a hundred. But besides all this, we have another testimony
by his son John, contained in a letter written to the venerable
father a few months only before his death. He says—“For many
years you have diligently fed the flock committed to your care with
the sincere milk of the Word. Many of them the Great Shepherd
has, by your hand, delivered from the hand of the Destroyer, some
of whom have already entered into peace, and some remain unto
this day. For myself, I doubt not but when your warfare is
accomplished you shall come to your grave, not with sorrow, but
as a ripe shock of corn, full of years and victories.”<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c014'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such a declaration sufficiently refutes the vague, floating idea
respecting Samuel Wesley’s want of ministerial success; but had
such testimony not existed, and had the idea mentioned been
strictly true, it would have been enough of honour, for even so
good a man as the Epworth rector, to be the author of some of the
best books in the English language, and to be the father of the
greatest evangelist of modern times, and of the best sacred bard
that has flourished since the days when the poetic lyre was made
to vibrate music so sweetly celestial, under the wondrous inspired
touch of David the son of Jesse.</p>

<p class='c001'>After this work was sent to press, the writer ascertained that the
story, given on the authority of John Wesley, page <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>, is not strictly
accurate. The following are the facts of the case, in brief:—Though
the Marquis of Normanby was probably the means of obtaining for
Samuel Wesley the rectory of South Ormsby, the real <em>patrons</em> of the
living were certain members of the Massingberd family. It also appears
that the house of the patron, which was situated in the parish,
was rented, not by the Marquis of Normanby, but by the Earl of
Castleton; and that it was the latter nobleman who so resented the
affront to his mistress, that Samuel Wesley found it expedient to
resign the living. According to the Bishop’s Register at Lincoln, Mr
Wesley took possession of the South Ormsby Rectory on the 25th of
June 1691.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Solemn League and Covenant was a contract agreed to by the Scots, in
the year 1638, for maintaining their religion free from innovation. In 1643 it
was brought into England; and on February 2, of that year, it was enacted, by a
joint ordinance of both Houses of Parliament, “that the League and Covenant
should be solemnly taken and subscribed, in all places throughout the kingdom
of England and dominion of Wales, by all persons above the age of eighteen.”
Accordingly, it was signed by most of the members of the two houses of legislature,
by all the principal officers of the rebel army, by all the <em>Divines</em> of the
<em>Assembly</em> then sitting at Westminster, and by a large number of the people in
general. Two of the principal vows were—1. That the party taking and subscribing
the Covenant would endeavour to “bring the Churches of God in all the
three kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion, confession
of faith, and form of church government, as the <em>Directory</em> prescribes for worship
and catechising.” And, 2. That he would “endeavour, without respect of persons,
to extirpate Popery and Prelacy—that is to say, church government by archbishops
and bishops.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. And yet, perhaps this is hardly true. A most pitiful picture might be drawn
of the clergymen who, twenty years previously, had been expelled from the same
churches by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipse dixit</i></span> of Oliver Cromwell, whom Bishop Hackett represents
as regarding neither parliaments nor patents—neither canons nor scriptures—“in
comparison of some new light shining in the lantern of his own head.” Men of
learning and religion were in many instances succeeded by “mere rhapsodists and
ramblers,” “cried up as rare soul-saving preachers.” Not a few venerable and
worthy ministers, expelled by the rough hand of violence, “lingered out their
lives, laden and almost oppressed, worried, and worn out with fears, anxieties,
necessities, rude affronts, and remediless afflictions.” A great deal may be said
on both sides of the question.</p>

have been proud, haughty, vindictive, cruel, and unrelenting; and though he
approved himself an obedient subject, he certainly became one of the most intolerable
sovereigns that ever reigned over a free people. He could have no true religion,
at least while in England, as he made no conscience at all of adultery. He
is said afterwards to have been a new man. Probably the loss of his crown was
the saving of his soul.”—<span class='sc'>Wesley’s</span> <cite>History of England</cite>, vol. iii., p. 348.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. About the year 1720, Samuel Annesley, strangely enough, employed his
brother-in-law, Samuel Wesley, to act as his agent in England; and the result
was a serious quarrel. Annesley charged him with having received sums of
money for which he had never accounted, and for having laid out moneys contrary
to explicit orders. Mrs Wesley took up the matter, and, in a long letter,
defended her husband against the attacks of her brother. She says, Mr Wesley
has orders for the money laid out; and that, though his expenses had been great,
they were honest. Mr Wesley, in attending to Mr Annesley’s business, had been
compelled to be much from home, and, therefore, had been compelled to hire a
curate to supply his place. Besides, Annesley had promised him a commission
for business done on his account during the three years Wesley sat in Convocation,
but the commission had not been paid. Mrs Wesley proposed to refer all their
disputes to arbitration; and says, that if Mr Wesley is found to be in Mr Annesley’s
debt, both she and her husband are quite willing for him to sequester the Epworth
living in payment. Annesley had alleged that the Epworth living was worth
£300 a-year, and that, on account of the difference in the cost of maintenance,
this was equal to a living of £ 1000 a-year in London and its immediate neighbourhood.
Mrs Wesley says, “it may full as truly be said that the Epworth living is
£10,000 as £300; and even were it £300, there is no such difference in the price
of provision as to justify” Annesley’s computation. In fact, the living did not
yield them, in clear money, more than £130 a-year; and, all things considered, it
was quite as costly to live at Epworth as it was to live in London. Mrs Wesley
then declares that her husband challenges the whole world to prove him a knave;
that she conceals the wants of her family from him as much as possible, because,
if he were made acquainted with each particular, he would hazard his health, perhaps
his life, in riding to borrow money, rather than his wife and his children should
be so distressed. She adds—“He hath not deceived you; and, to say the truth,
among all his wants sincerity is none. I have not reason to complain of his being
deceitful, but have often blamed him for speaking his mind too freely. You think
him too zealous for the party he fancies in the right, and that he has unluckily
to do with the opposite faction. Mr Wesley is not factious. He is zealous in a
good cause, as every one ought to be; but the furthest from being a party man
of any man in the world.” The whole of this very long and painfully-interesting
letter may be read in the <cite>Wesleyan Times</cite> for January 15, 1866.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. The edition of the “Dunciad” in which Wesley appeared was a surreptitious
one. The following were the lines printed:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How all the suffering brotherhood retire,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The author of “The Life and Times of Dr Isaac Watts” affirms that Watts remonstrated
with Pope, and, in consequence, his name was deprived of the undesirable
distinction. He also adds, that “the elder Wesley’s name was probably
omitted owing to the interposition of his son Samuel, who corresponded with
Pope, and was highly esteemed by him,” (Watts’ <cite>Life</cite>, p. 436.) There may be
some truth in this. In an edition of the “Dunciad” now lying before us, and
published in 1729, the last line is printed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Well purged, and worthy Withers, Quarles, and Blome.”</div>

<p class='c016'>And to this is appended the following note:—“It was printed in the surreptitious
editions, ‘W—ly, W—s,’ who were persons eminent for good life; the one writ
the ‘Life of Christ’ in verse; the other some valuable pieces in the lyric kind on
pious subjects. The line is here restored according to its original.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f114'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r114'>114</a>. Timothy Rogers was a Nonconformist preacher; a good man, to whom
Samuel Wesley, in a subsequent letter, acknowledges himself greatly indebted.
Besides his voluminous funeral sermon for Mrs Dunton, he published a book,
entitled, “Fall not out by the Way; or, A Persuasion to a Friendly Correspondence
between the Conformists and Nonconformists.” Judging from the funeral
sermon now before us, he was a man of great vivacity, wit, and mental vigour.
He was also imbued with a thoroughly catholic and Christian spirit. “The way
to agreement of all parties,” he writes, “is not to bring men to be of one
opinion, but to be of one mind; which we may be, not by thinking the same
things, but by thinking well one of another, endeavouring to preserve charity as
carefully as to preserve truth. Carnal zeal may put us on disputing, but true
zeal will put us upon prayer. For my part, I had rather be a quiet ploughman
than a fiery philosopher.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f115'>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r122'>122</a>. Bishop Burnet states that there had formerly been societies of this description
both among the Puritans and Dissenters; but the societies which now
sprung up belonged to the Established Church. He adds, they were chiefly conducted
by Dr Beveridge and Dr Horneck. Some disliked them, and were afraid
they might give birth to new factions; but wiser and better men thought it was
not fit to check a spirit of devotion at such a time. After the Revolution, these
societies became more numerous; and, by means of their collections, maintained
clergymen to read prayers at so many places, and at so many different hours,
that devout persons might avail themselves of the privilege of joining in sacred
worship at every hour of the day. There were constant sacraments in many
churches every Sabbath; and there were greater numbers present at both
prayers and sacraments than had been observed in the memory of man. The
societies began to inform the magistrates of swearers, drunkards, Sabbath-breakers,
and adulterers; and, because of this, they were called Societies of Reformation.
Some of the magistrates encouraged them, but others treated them roughly.
Some of the societies set themselves to raise charity schools; others printed
books, and distributed them over the nation; and were, therefore, called societies
for propagating Christian knowledge. In many places of the nation the clergy
met together to confer about matters of religion and learning. And, last of all,
a corporation was created by King William for propagating the Gospel among
infidels, and for settling schools in our plantations.—<cite>Burnet’s History of his own

National Reformation of Manners, Humbly Offered to the Consideration of our
Magistrates and Clergy. Published by the Society for Reformation. London:
Printed for John Dunton, 1694.” In the preface it is stated, that “Atheism and
profaneness never got such an ascendancy as at this day. A thick gloominess
hath overspread our horizon, and our light looks like the evening of the
world.” After dwelling on the sins of the nation, it is recommended—1. “That
there be a solemn fast, without any appearance of ornament among us, from the
highest to the lowest.” 2. “That care be taken to establish justice and judgment
unto the poor and needy, the destitute, and the oppressed.” 3. “That
there be a yearly allowance for defraying the necessary expenses of carrying on
this work of Reformation of Manners.” 4. “That the King and Queen be supplicated
to suppress play-houses.” 5. “That great care be taken to put a difference
between the clean and unclean in the visible Church, and not to admit all sorts
of loose professors to the Holy Communion.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r154'>154</a>. Three years previous to this, Thomas Firmin, a famous citizen of London, had
died; a man held in high esteem for his charities of all sorts, private and public.
Firmin, in early life, sat under the ministry of John Goodwin, but was afterwards
converted to Socinianism by John Biddle, already mentioned in this history.
Firmin was a man of great wealth, and promoted the printing of books against
the Trinity, and distributed them freely over the nation, to all who would accept
of them. The result was, the greatest mysteries in religion became the common
topic of discourse, and were treated as the contrivances of priests to bring the
world into blind submission to their authority. This raised a great outcry against
Socinianism; and, as Tillotson and some of the bishops had lived in great friendship
with Mr Firmin, (because of his charitable temper, which they thought it
became them to encourage,) books like “Essays on the Balance of Power,” began
to be put in circulation—(See Burnet’s <cite>History of His Own Time</cite>. 1st Edit.,

but those of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. To them she had sacrificed
affections, prejudices, habits, interests. In obedience to them, she had joined in
the conspiracy against her father. She had fled from Whitehall in the depth of
winter, through ice and mire, to a hackney coach. She had taken refuge in the
rebel camp. She had consented to yield her place in the order of succession to the
Prince of Orange. While a large party was disposed to make her an idol, the
Duke and Duchess of Marlborough regarded her merely as their puppet, and no
person, who had a natural interest in Anne, could observe, without uneasiness,
the strange infatuation which made her the slave of an imperious and reckless
termagant.”</p>

some other important facts belonging to this period. He says, the Dissenters had
quarrels and disputes among themselves. The Independents were raising the old
Antinomian tenets, and the Presbyterians were accusing the Baptists of giddiness.
One Asgil, a member of Parliament, published a book to prove that since believers
recovered in Christ all that they lost in Adam, they are now rendered immortal
by Christ, and not liable to death. George Keith, who, for thirty-six years, had
been the most learned man among the Quakers, now discovered that the Quakers
were Deists, and treated the Christian religion as allegorical; upon which he
opened a new meeting to convince the Quakers of their errors; and, having failed
in doing so, he was reconciled to the Established Church, and entered into holy
orders. The clergy also were much divided. Those who were now called the
High-Church party, had all along expressed a coldness to the present settlement,
and now began to complain about the grievances of the clergy, and the danger
the Church was in. Atterbury, who by his great ability and eloquence, had become
one of their leaders, attacked the supremacy of the crown in ecclesiastical
affairs, and the hot men of the clergy readily entertained his notions.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r212'>212</a>. At this time, says Bishop Burnet, there appeared an inclination in many of
the clergy to a nearer approach to the Church of Rome. Hicks, who was now at
the head of the Jacobite party, had, in several books, promoted the notion that
there was a proper sacrifice made in the eucharist. He also openly condemned
the supremacy of the crown in ecclesiastical affairs, and the method in which the
Reformation was carried. One Brett preached a sermon, in several of the pulpits
of London, which he afterwards printed, in which he said no repentance could
serve without priestly absolution, and affirmed that the priest was vested with the
same power of pardoning that our Saviour himself had. Another conceit was the
invalidity of lay baptism, and that, as dissenting teachers were laymen, they and
their congregations ought to be rebaptized. Dodwell left all who died without the
sacraments to the uncovenanted mercies of God; and maintained that none had
a right to give the sacraments except the apostles, and, after them, bishops and
priests ordained by them. The bishops thought it necessary to put a stop to such
doctrines, and agreed to a declaration against the irregularity of all baptism by
persons not in holy orders; but yet allowing that, according to the practice of the
primitive Church, and the constant usage of the Church of England, no baptism
ought to be reiterated. Archbishop Sharpe (the friend of Samuel Wesley) refused
to sign the declaration, pretending that it would encourage irregular baptisms.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, with most of the bishops of his province, submitted
the matter to the convocation. It was agreed to in the Upper House, but the
Lower House refused even to consider it, because it would encourage those who
struck at the dignity of the priesthood. This was all that passed in the convocation
of 1712.—(Burnet’s <cite>History of His Own Times</cite>, 1st edit., vol. ii. p. 605.)</p>

as appears from the dedication of his son Samuel’s poems to that nobleman. He
writes:—“Neither obscurity of condition, nor distance of place, could prevent
your lordship from distinguishing and encouraging a worthy clergyman, my
father, in his indefatigable researches after truth, and his unfashionable studies in
divinity; which, perhaps, might have been left unfinished without that encouragement.”—<cite>Poems

<p class='c001'><a href='#r267'>267</a>. The editor of Dr Clarke’s <cite>Wesley Family</cite> has thrown out the hint that
it is not improbable that the “Clergyman’s Vade Mecum” was written by
Samuel Wesley; but I can find no evidence of this. The third edition of this
work, published, in 2 vols., in 1709, is now before me. The full title of the first
volume is, “The Clergyman’s Vade Mecum; or, an Account of the Ancient and
Present Church of England; the Duties and Rights of the Clergy, and of their
Privileges and Hardships; containing full Directions relating to Ordination, Institution,
Induction, and most of the Difficulties which they commonly meet
with in the Discharge of their Office.” The title of the second volume is, “The
Clergyman’s Vade Mecum, Part II.; containing the Canonical Codes of the Primitive,
Universal, Eastern, and Western Church, down to the year of our Lord
787. Done from the Original Greek and Latin; omitting no Canon, Decree, or
any part of them that is curious or instructive. With explanatory Notes, a large
Index, and a Preface showing the usefulness of the work; with some Reflections
on Moderate Nonconformity, and the Rights of the Church.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r268'>268</a>. In an article in the <cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, vol. i. p. 459, on the use of extempore
prayer, Samuel Wesley seems to be in favour of a medium between the use of
extempore prayer and a form of prayer. This he calls “premeditated prayer;”
that is, premeditated not in reference to words but things. At the same time he
says—“There are very few who have command of words enough to express themselves
as they ought on such an occasion, and therefore a <em>form</em> is the safe way.”</p>

brothers, until the 4th of March 1735, which was within two months of their
father’s death. John, however, at that time, remained as firmly convinced as ever

poetical and controversial pieces. He had for some years been composing a
critical ‘Dissertation on the Book of Job,’ which he has left unfinished, and almost

<div class='footnote' id='f358'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r358'>358</a>. Once more we protest against this. What were High Church principles and
politics? Bishop Burnet, who flourished at the time when the names of High
Church and Low Church were first introduced, shall answer. He writes, (<cite>History
of Own Times</cite>, vol. ii. p. 347:)—“All that treated the Dissenters with temper
and moderation, and were for residing constantly at their cures, and for
labouring diligently in them; that expressed a zeal against the Prince of Wales,
and for the Revolution; that wished well to the present war, and to the alliance
against France, were called Low Churchmen.” If such was a Low Churchman,
of course, a High Churchman was just the opposite. Who, in the face of this,
will pretend to say that Samuel Wesley was “of High Church principles, and
High Church politics?”</p>

<p class='c001'>On p. <a href='#Page_126'>126</a>, there is a quotation from Macualay which is an abridgement
of the original, including a passage from a footnote, which resulted
in a confusion of quotation and embedded quotation marks. These
have been sorted out.</p>

<p class='c001'>On pp. <a href='#note144'>144–145</a>, there is a series of citations from the
<cite>Athenian Oracle</cite>, which are sometimes paraphrased or elided.
It seems the printer had no firm grasp on the boundaries of the various
citations. An apparently spurious opening quotation mark has been removed
on p. <a href='#Page_145'>145</a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>On p. <a href='#Page_200'>200</a>, in the recounting of Mr Wesley’s children, several birthdates
are given in the wrong century (1794 and 1795, rather than one hundred
years earlier).</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no footnote marker for was is now footnote <a href='#f336'>336</a> on
p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>. One was placed where it seemed most pertinent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
